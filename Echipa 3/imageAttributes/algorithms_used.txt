Algorithms :

  - color naming histogram  - files with code CN
    used for filtering image with the same, or a similar color profile
    
  - histogram of oriented gradients - files with code HOG
    used for object detection capabilities: filtering out images with same object/artefacts present inside
    
  - color moments - files with code CM
    used for comparing images based on color; regularly used in image retrieval systems
      ( according to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Color_moments );
