Belém Tower (in Portuguese Torre de Belém, pron. IPA: ['toɾ(ɨ) dɨ bɨ'lɐ̃ĩ]) is a fortified tower located in the Belém district of Lisbon, Portugal. It was built in the early 16th century in the Portuguese late Gothic style, the Manueline, to commemorate Vasco da Gama's expedition. This defensive, yet elegant construction has become one of the symbols of the city, a memorial to the Portuguese power during the Age of the Great Discoveries. In 1983 it was classified, together with the nearby Mosteiro dos Jerónimos, as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. [edit]History The Belém Tower was built both as a ceremonial gateway to Lisbon and as part of a defense system of the entrance of the Tagus river and the Jerónimos Monastery, which was necessary to protect Lisbon. The system was initiated by King John II (1455-1495), who built the Fortress of Cascais and the Fortress of São Sebastião of Caparica. The banks of Belém were protected by a ship, the Grande Nau, replaced by the Tower of Belém during the last five years of the reign of King Manuel I. Renaissance loggia on the first floor of Belém Tower. The Tower was constructed between 1515 and 1521 by military architect Francisco de Arruda, who had already built several fortresses in Portuguese possessions in Morocco. The influence of the Moorish decorative art is manifest in delicate decorations of the arched windows and balconies and in the ribbed cupolas of the watch towers. Diogo de Boitaca, first architect of the nearby Monastery of the Jerónimos, probably also participated in decorating the building. The machicolation and the battlements are decorated with the rich sculptural ornamentations of the Manueline style. Originally, the Tower stood on a little island on the right side of the Tagus, surrounded by water. Opposite the beach at Restelo, with the progressive southward creeping of the shore over the years, it is now practically moored to the bank itself. It was dedicated to the patron saint of Lisbon, St Vincent. In 1580, when Lisbon was invaded by Spanish troops in the course of a struggle for the Portuguese throne, the Tower fought and surrendered to the Duke of Alba. In the following centuries the Tower was mainly used as a prison (with the underground cellars regularly flooding) and as a custom house. Indeed, given its height and lack of dissimulation in the landscape, some historians believe the Tower was mostly intended to serve as a customs outpost. In the 1840s, under the impulse of romantic writer Almeida Garrett, the Tower of Belém was restored by King Ferdinand II. At this point many neo-manueline decorative elements were added to the building. It was declared a National Monument in 1910. [edit]Art and architecture Casemate of the bastion of Belém Tower. The Tower of Belém is considered one of the main works of the Portuguese late gothic, the manueline style. Indeed, the tower is decorated with several typical Manueline motifs like the armillary sphere (the symbol of Manuel I), the cross of the Order of Christ (to which Manuel I belonged), twisted ropes, elaborate rib vaulting and other features. However, some of the decoration dates from the renovation of the 1840s, like the shields with the cross of the military Order of Christ, that decorate the crenellations of the walls, and the decoration of the small cloister of the bastion. The part of the tower facing the river displays the richest decorations. The Tower of Belém can be divided into two parts, the bastion, with the shape of an irregular hexagon, and the five-story tower itself, located on the north side of the bastion. The whole ensemble looks like the bow of a caravel. Crenelated tower with Manueline decorations The bastion has a vaulted chamber (the casemate), with openings in the 3.5 m-thick walls for the 17 large-calibre breech-loading cannons. The open centre above the casemate made it easier to dispel the fumes and smokes. The bastion platform could also be used for the emplacement of light-calibre guns. This was the first Portuguese fortification with a two-level gun emplacement and it marks a new development in military architecture. The corners of this platform have delicate turrets (guerites) topped by Moorish-looking cupolas. The base of the turrets have images of beasts, including a rhinoceros, considered to be the first sculpture of such an animal in Western European art. This rhinoceros probably depicts the one that Manuel I sent to the Pope in 1515. On the platform, in front of the tower, stands a statue of the Madonna of Belém with Child and a bunch of grapes in her left hand in a richly carved niche with a baldachin in Manueline style. The same turrets occur on the upper platform of the tower. The entrance to the Tower is done through a portal decorated with many Manueline motifs, including Manuel I's badge of honour (an armillary sphere). The whole tower is also decorated with stone twisted ropes, which even tie a knot at the north façade of the building. Tower lit up at night The upper corners of the tower walls have statues of St Vincent and St Michael, as well as many fine windows with arches. The renaissance-style covered loggia, running the full length of the south side of the first floor of the tower, is particularly delicate. It has a Venetian touch. The many shields that decorate the merlons are neo-manueline. The tower itself, 35 metres high, has four storeys and a terrace that offers wonderful views of the surrounding landscape. The powder magazine is at water level. The next storeys are reached via a narrow spiral staircase. The next storey was the commander's room. The second storey has covered balconies on each side. Of the tower floors, the most interesting is the chapel of the fourth floor, with a magnificent Manueline rib vault decorated with the armillary sphere and the cross of the military Order of Christ, who participated in many Portuguese conquests. The oratory is on the top floor." id="3132267544" latitude="38.692293" license="4" longitude="-9.216156" nbComments="34" rank="6" tags="belem belemstower gothicstyle ilustrarportugal lisbon portugal sixteencentury stone tagusriver thecontinuum unesco unescoworldheritagesite flickrduel" title="Belem's Tower" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/3227/3132267544_9b126b95c0_b.jpg" username="pedrosimoes7" views="2781" />

In 1983 it was classified by the UNESCO, with nearby Torre de Belém, as a World Heritage Site. The house for the Hieronymite monks was built on the same site of the Ermida do Restelo, a hermitage that was founded by Henry the Navigator at about 1450. It was at this hermitage, that was already in disrepair, that Vasco da Gama and his men spent the night in prayer before departing for India in 1497. The existing structure was started on the orders of Manuel I (1515-1520) to commemorate Vasco da Gama's successful return from India. It was originally meant as a church for the burial of the House of Aviz, but it also became a house of prayer for seamen leaving or entering port. Construction of the monastery began in 1502 and took 50 years to complete. He used pedra lioz, a local gold-coloured limestone, for its construction. The building of the monastery was funded by a 5% tax on eastern spices, with the exceptions of pepper, cinnamon and cloves, revenue from which went straight to the Crown. By this influx of riches, the architects had enough financial margin to think big. The enormous amount of funds needed for this monastery, meant abandoning the construction of the Aviz pantheon in the Monastery of Batalha. The monastery was designed in the Manueline style by Diogo de Boitaca (who was probably one of the originators of this style with the Igreja de Jesus in Setúbal). He built the church, the monastery, the sacristy and the refectory. He was succeeded by the Spaniard João de Castilho, who took charge of construction in around 1517. João de Castilho gradually moved from the Manueline style to the Plateresco style, a style with lavish decorations that remind of silver ware (plata = silver). There were several sculptors who made their mark on this building. Nicolau Chanterene added depth with his Renaissance themes. The construction came to a halt when the king Manuel I died in 1520. The architect Diogo de Torralva resumed the construction of the monastery in 1550, adding the main chapel, the choir and completing the two storeys of the monastery, using only Renaissance motifs. His work was continued in 1571 by Jérôme de Rouen (also called Jerónimo de Ruão) who added some Classical elements. The construction stopped in 1580 with the union of Spain and Portugal, because the building of the Escorial in Spain was now draining away all the funds. The monastery withstood the Great Earthquake of 1755 without too much damage. But when the building became vacant in 1833 by the abolition of the religious orders in Portugal, it began to deteriorate to the point of almost collapsing.

<photo  date_taken="2010-07-15 16:27:57" description="Instituto Camões, Lisbon, Portugal in Wikipedia Luís Vaz de Camões (Portuguese pronunciation: [luˈiʃ vaʃ dɨ kaˈmõȷ̃ʃ]; sometimes rendered in English as Camoens; c. 1524 – June 10, 1580) is considered Portugal's, and the Portuguese language's greatest poet. His mastery of verse has been compared to that of Shakespeare, Vondel, Homer, Virgil, and Dante. He wrote a considerable amount of lyrical poetry (in Portuguese and in Spanish) and drama but is best remembered for his epic work Os Lusíadas (The Lusiads). His recollection of poetry The Parnasum of Luís de Camões was lost in his lifetime. Many details concerning the life of Camões remain unknown, but he is thought to have been born around 1524. Luís Vaz de Camões, the only son and child of Simão Vaz de Camões and wife Ana de Sá de Macedo[1]. His birthplace is unknown. Lisbon, Coimbra or Alenquer are frequently presented as his birthplace, although the latter is based on what may be a wrong interpretation of one of his poems. Camões belongs to a family originating from the northern Portuguese region of Chaves near Galicia. At an early age, Simão Vaz left his son and wife to discover personal riches in India, only to die in Goa in the following years. His mother later re-married. Monument to Luís de Camões, Lisbon Camões lived a semi-privileged life and was educated by Dominicans and Jesuits. For a period, due to his familial relations he attended the University of Coimbra, although records do not show him registered (he participated in courses in the Humanities). His uncle, Bento de Camões, is credited with this education, owing to his position as Prior at the Monastery of Santa Cruz and Chancellor at the University of Coimbra. He frequently had access to exclusive literature, including classical Greek, Roman and Latin works, read Latin, Italian and wrote in Spanish. Camões, as his love poetry can attest, was a romantic and idealist. It was rumored that he fell in love with Catherine of Ataíde, lady-in-waiting to the Queen, and also the Princess Maria, sister of John III of Portugal. It is also likely that an indiscreet allusion to the king in his play El-Rei Seleuco, as well as these other incidents may have played a part in his exile from Lisbon in 1548. He traveled to the Ribatejo where he stayed in the company of friends who sheltered and fed him. He stayed in the province for about six months. He enlisted in the overseas militia, and traveled to Ceuta in the fall of 1549. During a battle with the Moors, he lost the sight in his right eye. He eventually returned to Lisbon in 1551, a changed man, living a bohemian lifestyle. In 1552, during the religious festival of Corpus Christi, in the Largo do Rossio, he injured Gonçalo Borges, a member of the Royal Stables. Camões was imprisoned. His mother pleaded for his release, visiting royal ministers and the Borges family for a pardon. Released, Camões was ordered to pay 4,000 réis and serve three-years in the militia in the Orient. He departed in 1553 for Goa on board the São Bento, commanded by Fernão Alves Cabral. The ship arrived six months later. In Goa, Camões was imprisoned for debt. He found Goa &amp;quot;a step-mother to all honest men&amp;quot; but he studied local customs and mastered the local geography and history. On his first expedition, he joined a battle along the Malabar Coast. The battle was followed by skirmishes along the trading routes between Egypt and India. The fleet eventually returned to Goa by November 1554. During his time ashore, he continued his writing publicly, as well as writing correspondence for the uneducated men of the fleet. At the end of his obligatory service, he was given the position of chief warrant officer in Macau. He was charged with managing the properties of missing and deceased soldiers in the Orient. During this time he worked on his epic poem Os Lusíadas (&amp;quot;The Lusiads&amp;quot;) in a grotto. He was later accused of misappropriations and traveled to Goa to respond to the accusations of the tribunal. During his return journey, near the Mekong River along the Cambodian coast, he was shipwrecked, saving his manuscript but losing his Chinese lover. His shipwreck survival in the Mekong Delta was enhanced by the legendary detail that he succeeded in swimming ashore while holding aloft the manuscript of his still-unfinished epic. In 1570 Camões finally made it back to Lisbon, where two years later he published Os Lusíadas. In recompense for his poem or perhaps for services in the Far East, he was granted a small royal pension by the young and ill-fated King Sebastian (ruled 1557–1578). In 1578 he heard of the appalling defeat of the Battle of Alcazarquivir, where King Sebastian was killed and the Portuguese army destroyed. The Spanish troops were approaching Lisbon[citation needed] when Camões wrote to the Captain General of Lamego: &amp;quot;All will see that so dear to me was my country that I was content to die not only in it but with it&amp;quot;. Camões died in Lisbon in 1580, at the age of 56. The day of his death, 10 June, is Portugal's national day. He is buried near Vasco Da Gama in the Hieronymite Monastery in the Belém district of Lisbon.

Diseñado en estilo manuelino por el arquitecto Juan de Castillo, fue encargado por el rey Manuel I de Portugal para conmemorar el afortunado regreso de la India de Vasco de Gama, se fundó en 1501 en la antigua ermita fundada por el Infante D. Enrique. La primera etapa constructiva de la iglesia nueva comienza en 1514 y fue ampliándose y modificándose hasta el siglo XX. Se financió gracias al 5% de los impuestos obtenidos de las especias orientales, a excepción de los de la pimienta, la canela y el clavo, cuyas rentas iban directamente a la Corona. Este monasterio fue levantado sobre el enclave de la Ermida do Restelo en lo que fue la playa de Restelo, ermita fundada por Enrique el Navegante, y en la cual, Vasco de Gama y sus hombres pasaron la noche en oración antes de partir hacia la India. El estilo manuelino se caracteriza por la mezcla de motivos arquitectónicos y decorativos del gótico tardío y del renacimiento. Destacan los portales principal y lateral, el interior de la iglesia y el magnífico claustro. Las capillas de la iglesia fueron remodeladas en puro estilo renacentista en la segunda mitad del siglo XVI y contienen las arcas funerarias de Manuel I y su familia, además de otros reyes de Portugal. En los Jerónimos se hallan también las tumbas (neomanuelinas) del navegador Vasco da Gama y el poeta Luís de Camões. En una capilla del claustro descansan, desde 1985, los restos del escritor Fernando Pessoa. En un anexo construido en 1850 se ubica el Museo Nacional de Arqueología, el Museu da Marinha se encuentra en el ala oeste. En diciembre de 2007 se firmo en este monasterio el Tratado de Lisboa, un acuerdo de la Unión Europea que sustiyute la Constitución Europea y reforma los tratados que estaban vigentes. Este monasterio, al igual que la cercana Torre de Belém y el Monumento a los Descubrimientos simboliza la Era de las exploraciones portuguesa y se cuenta entre las principales atracciones turísticas de Lisboa. La primera etapa constructiva se encargó al arquitecto de origen francés, el maestro Diogo Boytac (o Boitaca), autor de la primitiva iglesia de Jesús de Setúbal. Su proyecto no fue llevado a cabo pues fue sustituido por el proyecto del siguiente arquitecto, Juan de Castillo. Boytac trabajó en el edificio en los años de 1514 y 1516. Planificó la obra siguiendo las normas imperantes del momento por toda Europa del gótico final. De esta etapa poco queda hoy. En 1516 le sucedió en las obras Juan de Castillo (en Portugal era conocido como João de Castilho). Juan de Castillo era de origen español según acredita un documento en que sus parientes dicen Juan de Castillo era natural de la Merindad de Trasmiera del reino de Castilla… concretamente de Castillo, pequeña localidad de la comarca de Trasmiera en Cantabria. Se sabe que trabajó en España hasta 1505. Con Castillo la obra comienza en su mayor diménsión y se corresponde con las mejores partes del edificio en estilo manuelino conjugándolo con el plateresco y estructuras renacentistas. Bajo su dirección se construyó la iglesia con las más osadas bóvedas, el claustro, la sacristía, la sala capitular y el refectorio. A la muerte del rey Manuel (1521) las obras no se paralizaron y continuarón en tiempos del rey Juan III, hasta que más tarde continuaron con el arquitecto español Diego de Torralva en 1544. La fecha aparece grabada en la piedra. La diferencia de estilo de este arquitecto con respecto al los anteriores se muestra sobre todo en el gran friso alto realizado por Diego de la Zarza y en la introducción de los medallones vueltos de lado. El monasterio fue confiado a los jerónimos, que estuvieron en él hasta 1833 en que fueron expulsados por la autoridad civil. El claustro se encuentra situado junto a la nave norte del templo. Fue diseñado por Juan de Castillo. Fue realizado entre 1517 y 1519 con varias contratas y subcontratas dando lugar a un resultado final de armonía y uniformidad. Todo el claustro está ampliamente decorado con motivos manuelinos (letra M, esfera armilar, cabos marineros, temas religiosos, hornacinas, medallones, etc.). Desde el piso de arriba se puede acceder al coro alto de la iglesia, que fue construido por Torralva en el siglo XVI. En él se halla una importante sillería también del XVI.

The monastery is one of the most prominent monuments of the Manueline-style architecture (Portuguese late-Gothic) in Lisbon, classified in 1983 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, along with the nearby Tower of Belém. The construction of the monastery and church began on 6 January 1501 (and were completed 100 years later). King Manuel originally funded the project with money obtained from the Vintena da Pimenta, a 5% tax on commerce from Africa and the Orient, equivalent to 70 kilograms (150 lb) of gold per year, with the exception of pepper, cinnamon and cloves (which went directly to the Crown. With the influx of riches, the architects were not limited to small plans, and resources already perscribed for the Monastery of Batalha (including the Aviz pantheon) were redirected to the project in Belém. Manuel I selected the religious order of Hieronymite monks to occupy the monastery, whose role it was to pray for the King's eternal soul and to provide spiritual assistance to navigators and sailors who departed from the beach of Restelo to discover the world.[2][1] This the monks did until 1833 (over four centuries), when the religious orders were dissolved and the monastery was unoccupied. The monastery was designed in a style that later became known as Manueline: a richly ornate architectural design that includes complex sculptural themes incorporating maritime elements and objects discovered during naval expeditions, carved in limestone. Diogo de Boitaca,[1] the architect, pioneered this style in the Monastery of Jesus in Setúbal. On this project Boitaca was responsible for the plans and contracting work on the monastery, the sacristy, and the refectory. He used calcário de lioz, a local gold-coloured limestone, that was quarried from Ajuda, the valley of Alcántara, Laveiras, Rio Seco and Tercena, for its construction. Boitaca was succeeded by the Spaniard Juan de Castilho, who took charge of construction around 1517. Castilho gradually moved from the Manueline to the Spanish Plateresque style, an ornamentation that included lavish decorations that recall silverware (Spanish: plata). The construction came to a halt when the King Manuel I died in 1521. There were several sculptors who made their mark on this building. Nicolau Chanterene added depth with hisRenaissance themes. The architect Diogo de Torralva resumed the construction of the monastery in 1550, adding the main chapel, the choir, and completing the two stories of the monastery, using only Renaissance motifs. Diogo de Torralva's work was continued in 1571 by Jérôme de Rouen (also called Jerónimo de Ruão) who added some Classical elements. The construction stopped in 1580 with the union of Spain and Portugal, because the building of the Escorial in Spain was now draining away all the funds. Work on the vast square cloister (55 x 55 m) of the monastery was begun by Boitac. He built the groin vaults with wide arches and windows with tracery resting on delicate mullions. Juan de Castilho finished the construction by giving the lower storey a classical overlay and building a more recessed upper-storey. The construction of such a cloister was a novelty at the time. Castilho changed the original round columns of Boitac into rectangular ones, and embellished it with Plateresque-style ornamentation. Each wing consists of six bays with tracery vaults. The four inner bays rest on massive buttresses, forming broad arcades. The corner bays are linked by a diagonal arched construction and show the richly decorated corner pillars. The cloister had a religious function as well as a representative function by its decorative ornamentation and the dynastic symbolic motives, such as the armillarium, coat-of-arms, and the cross from the Order of Christ, showing the growing world power of Portugal. The inside walls of the cloister have a wealth of Manueline motives with nautical elements, in addition to European, Moorish and Eastern motifs. The round arches and the horizontal structure are clearly in line with the Renaissance style, while at the same time there is also a relationship with Spanish architecture. The decorations on the outer walls of the inner courtyard were made in Plateresco style by Castilho: the arcades include traceried arches that give the construction a filigree aspect.

Los críticos de arte consideran este monasterio como la joya del estilo manuelino y uno de los monumentos más importantes de Lisboa y Portugal. El interior es muy amplio y luminoso, con una sola nave de planta salón y una abigarrada decoración manuelina. La bóveda del crucero es grandiosa y cubre una superficie de 29 x 19 metros, sin apoyos centrales y con una compleja red de nervaduras. Fue diseñada por Juan de Castillo en 1522. La bóveda de la nave también fue diseñada por él y fue realizada en 1520. La Capilla mayor fue reformada posteriormente por el maestro Jerónimo Ruão en estilo renacentista avanzado con el mismo estilo que la capilla mayor de la iglesia del Monasterio de El Escorial. En el retablo destaca sobre todo el sagrario, pieza de orfebrería portuguesa del siglo XVIII de gran calidad. Es también de gran importancia el conjunto pictórico compuesto por unas tablas con el tema de la vida de Jesús. En esta capilla se encuentran apoyadas sobre leones las tumbas del rey Manuel I y su esposa María y de Joao III y Catarina de Austria.

The architect Diogo de Torralva resumed the construction of the monastery in 1550, adding the main chapel, the choir, and completing the two stories of the monastery, using only Renaissance motifs. Diogo de Torralva's work was continued in 1571 by Jérôme de Rouen (also called Jerónimo de Ruão) who added some Classical elements. The construction stopped in 1580 with the union of Spain and Portugal, because the building of the Escorial in Spain was now draining away all the funds. Diogo Boitac laid the foundations for this three-aisled church with five bays under a single vault, a clearly marked but only slightly projecting a transept and a raised choir. The hall church layout is composed of aisles and nave that are of equal height. Boitac built the walls of the church as far as the cornices and then started with the construction of the adjoining monastery. Juan de Castilho, a Spanish architect and sculptor, continued the construction in 1517. He completed the retaining walls and the unique single-span ribbed vault, a combination of stellar vaulting and tracery vaults spanning the 19 metre-wide church. Each set of ribs in the vaulting is secured by bosses. The bold design (1522) of the transversal vault of the transept lacks any piers or columns, while Boitac had originally planned three bays in the transept. The transept's unsupported vault gives the visitor the impression that it floats in the air. Castilho also decorated the six 25 metre-high, slender, articulated, octagonal columns with refined grotesque or floral elements typical of the Renaissance style. The construction of this late-Gothic hall is aesthetically and architecturally a masterwork: it augments the spatial effect of this vast building. The northern column closest to the transept there is a medallion that may have been intentionally included as a portrait of Boitac or Juan de Castilho. At the end of the side aisles and on both sides of the choir are altars (also in the Manueline-style) dating from the 16th and the 17th centuries. They are decorated with carved/sculpted wood and plated in golden and green pigment, one of which supports the image of Saint Jerome in multi-coloured enamelled terracotta. This chancel was ordered by Queen Catherine of Austria as the final resting place for the royal family. It is the work of Jerónimo de Ruão (Jean de Rouen) in the Classical style. The royal tombs rest on marble elephants and are set between Ionic pillars, topped by Corinthian pillars. The tombs on the left side of the choir belong to king Manuel I and his wife Maria of Aragon, while the tombs on the right side belong to King João III and his wife Queen Catherine of Austria.

Diseñado en estilo manuelino por el arquitecto Juan de Castillo, fue encargado por el rey Manuel I de Portugal para conmemorar el afortunado regreso de la India de Vasco de Gama, se fundó en 1501 en la antigua ermita fundada por el Infante D. Enrique. La primera etapa constructiva de la iglesia nueva comienza en 1514 y fue ampliándose y modificándose hasta el siglo XX. Se financió gracias al 5% de los impuestos obtenidos de las especias orientales, a excepción de los de la pimienta, la canela y el clavo, cuyas rentas iban directamente a la Corona. Este monasterio fue levantado sobre el enclave de la Ermida do Restelo en lo que fue la playa de Restelo, ermita fundada por Enrique el Navegante, y en la cual, Vasco de Gama y sus hombres pasaron la noche en oración antes de partir hacia la India. El estilo manuelino se caracteriza por la mezcla de motivos arquitectónicos y decorativos del gótico tardío y del renacimiento. Destacan los portales principal y lateral, el interior de la iglesia y el magnífico claustro. Las capillas de la iglesia fueron remodeladas en puro estilo renacentista en la segunda mitad del siglo XVI y contienen las arcas funerarias de Manuel I y su familia, además de otros reyes de Portugal. En los Jerónimos se hallan también las tumbas (neomanuelinas) del navegador Vasco da Gama y el poeta Luís de Camões. En una capilla del claustro descansan, desde 1985, los restos del escritor Fernando Pessoa. En un anexo construido en 1850 se ubica el Museo Nacional de Arqueología, el Museu da Marinha se encuentra en el ala oeste. En diciembre de 2007 se firmo en este monasterio el Tratado de Lisboa, un acuerdo de la Unión Europea que sustiyute la Constitución Europea y reforma los tratados que estaban vigentes. Este monasterio, al igual que la cercana Torre de Belém y el Monumento a los Descubrimientos simboliza la Era de las exploraciones portuguesa y se cuenta entre las principales atracciones turísticas de Lisboa. La primera etapa constructiva se encargó al arquitecto de origen francés, el maestro Diogo Boytac (o Boitaca), autor de la primitiva iglesia de Jesús de Setúbal. Su proyecto no fue llevado a cabo pues fue sustituido por el proyecto del siguiente arquitecto, Juan de Castillo. Boytac trabajó en el edificio en los años de 1514 y 1516. Planificó la obra siguiendo las normas imperantes del momento por toda Europa del gótico final. De esta etapa poco queda hoy. En 1516 le sucedió en las obras Juan de Castillo (en Portugal era conocido como João de Castilho). Juan de Castillo era de origen español según acredita un documento en que sus parientes dicen Juan de Castillo era natural de la Merindad de Trasmiera del reino de Castilla… concretamente de Castillo, pequeña localidad de la comarca de Trasmiera en Cantabria. Se sabe que trabajó en España hasta 1505. Con Castillo la obra comienza en su mayor diménsión y se corresponde con las mejores partes del edificio en estilo manuelino conjugándolo con el plateresco y estructuras renacentistas. Bajo su dirección se construyó la iglesia con las más osadas bóvedas, el claustro, la sacristía, la sala capitular y el refectorio. A la muerte del rey Manuel (1521) las obras no se paralizaron y continuarón en tiempos del rey Juan III, hasta que más tarde continuaron con el arquitecto español Diego de Torralva en 1544. La fecha aparece grabada en la piedra. La diferencia de estilo de este arquitecto con respecto al los anteriores se muestra sobre todo en el gran friso alto realizado por Diego de la Zarza y en la introducción de los medallones vueltos de lado. El monasterio fue confiado a los jerónimos, que estuvieron en él hasta 1833 en que fueron expulsados por la autoridad civil. Los críticos de arte consideran este monasterio como la joya del estilo manuelino y uno de los monumentos más importantes de Lisboa y Portugal. El interior es muy amplio y luminoso, con una sola nave de planta salón y una abigarrada decoración manuelina. La bóveda del crucero es grandiosa y cubre una superficie de 29 x 19 metros, sin apoyos centrales y con una compleja red de nervaduras. Fue diseñada por Juan de Castillo en 1522. La bóveda de la nave también fue diseñada por él y fue realizada en 1520. La Capilla mayor fue reformada posteriormente por el maestro Jerónimo Ruão en estilo renacentista avanzado con el mismo estilo que la capilla mayor de la iglesia del Monasterio de El Escorial. En el retablo destaca sobre todo el sagrario, pieza de orfebrería portuguesa del siglo XVIII de gran calidad. Es también de gran importancia el conjunto pictórico compuesto por unas tablas con el tema de la vida de Jesús. En esta capilla se encuentran apoyadas sobre leones las tumbas del rey Manuel I y su esposa María y de Joao III y Catarina de Austria.

The monastery is one of the most prominent monuments of the Manueline-style architecture (Portuguese late-Gothic) in Lisbon, classified in 1983 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, along with the nearby Tower of Belém. The construction of the monastery and church began on 6 January 1501 (and were completed 100 years later). King Manuel originally funded the project with money obtained from the Vintena da Pimenta, a 5% tax on commerce from Africa and the Orient, equivalent to 70 kilograms (150 lb) of gold per year, with the exception of pepper, cinnamon and cloves (which went directly to the Crown. With the influx of riches, the architects were not limited to small plans, and resources already perscribed for the Monastery of Batalha (including the Aviz pantheon) were redirected to the project in Belém. Manuel I selected the religious order of Hieronymite monks to occupy the monastery, whose role it was to pray for the King's eternal soul and to provide spiritual assistance to navigators and sailors who departed from the beach of Restelo to discover the world.[2][1] This the monks did until 1833 (over four centuries), when the religious orders were dissolved and the monastery was unoccupied. The monastery was designed in a style that later became known as Manueline: a richly ornate architectural design that includes complex sculptural themes incorporating maritime elements and objects discovered during naval expeditions, carved in limestone. Diogo de Boitaca,[1] the architect, pioneered this style in the Monastery of Jesus in Setúbal. On this project Boitaca was responsible for the plans and contracting work on the monastery, the sacristy, and the refectory. He used calcário de lioz, a local gold-coloured limestone, that was quarried from Ajuda, the valley of Alcántara, Laveiras, Rio Seco and Tercena, for its construction. Boitaca was succeeded by the Spaniard Juan de Castilho, who took charge of construction around 1517. Castilho gradually moved from the Manueline to the Spanish Plateresque style, an ornamentation that included lavish decorations that recall silverware (Spanish: plata).

The construction stopped in 1580 with the union of Spain and Portugal, because the building of the Escorial in Spain was now draining away all the funds. Work on the vast square cloister (55 x 55 m) of the monastery was begun by Boitac. He built the groin vaults with wide arches and windows with tracery resting on delicate mullions. Juan de Castilho finished the construction by giving the lower storey a classical overlay and building a more recessed upper-storey. The construction of such a cloister was a novelty at the time. Castilho changed the original round columns of Boitac into rectangular ones, and embellished it with Plateresque-style ornamentation. Each wing consists of six bays with tracery vaults. The four inner bays rest on massive buttresses, forming broad arcades. The corner bays are linked by a diagonal arched construction and show the richly decorated corner pillars. The cloister had a religious function as well as a representative function by its decorative ornamentation and the dynastic symbolic motives, such as the armillarium, coat-of-arms, and the cross from the Order of Christ, showing the growing world power of Portugal. The inside walls of the cloister have a wealth of Manueline motives with nautical elements, in addition to European, Moorish and Eastern motifs. The round arches and the horizontal structure are clearly in line with the Renaissance style, while at the same time there is also a relationship with Spanish architecture. The decorations on the outer walls of the inner courtyard were made in Plateresco style by Castilho: the arcades include traceried arches that give the construction a filigree aspect.

Manuel I selected the religious order of Hieronymite monks to occupy the monastery, whose role it was to pray for the King's eternal soul and to provide spiritual assistance to navigators and sailors who departed from the beach of Restelo to discover the world.[2][1] This the monks did until 1833 (over four centuries), when the religious orders were dissolved and the monastery was unoccupied. The monastery was designed in a style that later became known as Manueline: a richly ornate architectural design that includes complex sculptural themes incorporating maritime elements and objects discovered during naval expeditions, carved in limestone. Diogo de Boitaca,[1] the architect, pioneered this style in the Monastery of Jesus in Setúbal. On this project Boitaca was responsible for the plans and contracting work on the monastery, the sacristy, and the refectory. He used calcário de lioz, a local gold-coloured limestone, that was quarried from Ajuda, the valley of Alcántara, Laveiras, Rio Seco and Tercena, for its construction. Boitaca was succeeded by the Spaniard Juan de Castilho, who took charge of construction around 1517. Castilho gradually moved from the Manueline to the Spanish Plateresque style, an ornamentation that included lavish decorations that recall silverware (Spanish: plata). The construction came to a halt when the King Manuel I died in 1521. There were several sculptors who made their mark on this building. Nicolau Chanterene added depth with hisRenaissance themes. The architect Diogo de Torralva resumed the construction of the monastery in 1550, adding the main chapel, the choir, and completing the two stories of the monastery, using only Renaissance motifs. Diogo de Torralva's work was continued in 1571 by Jérôme de Rouen (also called Jerónimo de Ruão) who added some Classical elements. The construction stopped in 1580 with the union of Spain and Portugal, because the building of the Escorial in Spain was now draining away all the funds. Diogo Boitac laid the foundations for this three-aisled church with five bays under a single vault, a clearly marked but only slightly projecting a transept and a raised choir. The hall church layout is composed of aisles and nave that are of equal height. Boitac built the walls of the church as far as the cornices and then started with the construction of the adjoining monastery. Juan de Castilho, a Spanish architect and sculptor, continued the construction in 1517. He completed the retaining walls and the unique single-span ribbed vault, a combination of stellar vaulting and tracery vaults spanning the 19 metre-wide church. Each set of ribs in the vaulting is secured by bosses. The bold design (1522) of the transversal vault of the transept lacks any piers or columns, while Boitac had originally planned three bays in the transept. The transept's unsupported vault gives the visitor the impression that it floats in the air. Castilho also decorated the six 25 metre-high, slender, articulated, octagonal columns with refined grotesque or floral elements typical of the Renaissance style. The construction of this late-Gothic hall is aesthetically and architecturally a masterwork: it augments the spatial effect of this vast building. The northern column closest to the transept there is a medallion that may have been intentionally included as a portrait of Boitac or Juan de Castilho. At the end of the side aisles and on both sides of the choir are altars (also in the Manueline-style) dating from the 16th and the 17th centuries. They are decorated with carved/sculpted wood and plated in golden and green pigment, one of which supports the image of Saint Jerome in multi-coloured enamelled terracotta. This chancel was ordered by Queen Catherine of Austria as the final resting place for the royal family. It is the work of Jerónimo de Ruão (Jean de Rouen) in the Classical style. The royal tombs rest on marble elephants and are set between Ionic pillars, topped by Corinthian pillars. The tombs on the left side of the choir belong to king Manuel I and his wife Maria of Aragon, while the tombs on the right side belong to King João III and his wife Queen Catherine of Austria.

Diseñado en estilo manuelino por el arquitecto Juan de Castillo, fue encargado por el rey Manuel I de Portugal para conmemorar el afortunado regreso de la India de Vasco de Gama, se fundó en 1501 en la antigua ermita fundada por el Infante D. Enrique. La primera etapa constructiva de la iglesia nueva comienza en 1514 y fue ampliándose y modificándose hasta el siglo XX. Se financió gracias al 5% de los impuestos obtenidos de las especias orientales, a excepción de los de la pimienta, la canela y el clavo, cuyas rentas iban directamente a la Corona. Este monasterio fue levantado sobre el enclave de la Ermida do Restelo en lo que fue la playa de Restelo, ermita fundada por Enrique el Navegante, y en la cual, Vasco de Gama y sus hombres pasaron la noche en oración antes de partir hacia la India. El estilo manuelino se caracteriza por la mezcla de motivos arquitectónicos y decorativos del gótico tardío y del renacimiento. Destacan los portales principal y lateral, el interior de la iglesia y el magnífico claustro. Las capillas de la iglesia fueron remodeladas en puro estilo renacentista en la segunda mitad del siglo XVI y contienen las arcas funerarias de Manuel I y su familia, además de otros reyes de Portugal. En los Jerónimos se hallan también las tumbas (neomanuelinas) del navegador Vasco da Gama y el poeta Luís de Camões. En una capilla del claustro descansan, desde 1985, los restos del escritor Fernando Pessoa. En un anexo construido en 1850 se ubica el Museo Nacional de Arqueología, el Museu da Marinha se encuentra en el ala oeste. En diciembre de 2007 se firmo en este monasterio el Tratado de Lisboa, un acuerdo de la Unión Europea que sustiyute la Constitución Europea y reforma los tratados que estaban vigentes. Este monasterio, al igual que la cercana Torre de Belém y el Monumento a los Descubrimientos simboliza la Era de las exploraciones portuguesa y se cuenta entre las principales atracciones turísticas de Lisboa. La primera etapa constructiva se encargó al arquitecto de origen francés, el maestro Diogo Boytac (o Boitaca), autor de la primitiva iglesia de Jesús de Setúbal. Su proyecto no fue llevado a cabo pues fue sustituido por el proyecto del siguiente arquitecto, Juan de Castillo. Boytac trabajó en el edificio en los años de 1514 y 1516. Planificó la obra siguiendo las normas imperantes del momento por toda Europa del gótico final. De esta etapa poco queda hoy. En 1516 le sucedió en las obras Juan de Castillo (en Portugal era conocido como João de Castilho). Juan de Castillo era de origen español según acredita un documento en que sus parientes dicen Juan de Castillo era natural de la Merindad de Trasmiera del reino de Castilla… concretamente de Castillo, pequeña localidad de la comarca de Trasmiera en Cantabria. Se sabe que trabajó en España hasta 1505. Con Castillo la obra comienza en su mayor diménsión y se corresponde con las mejores partes del edificio en estilo manuelino conjugándolo con el plateresco y estructuras renacentistas. Bajo su dirección se construyó la iglesia con las más osadas bóvedas, el claustro, la sacristía, la sala capitular y el refectorio. A la muerte del rey Manuel (1521) las obras no se paralizaron y continuarón en tiempos del rey Juan III, hasta que más tarde continuaron con el arquitecto español Diego de Torralva en 1544. La fecha aparece grabada en la piedra. La diferencia de estilo de este arquitecto con respecto al los anteriores se muestra sobre todo en el gran friso alto realizado por Diego de la Zarza y en la introducción de los medallones vueltos de lado. El monasterio fue confiado a los jerónimos, que estuvieron en él hasta 1833 en que fueron expulsados por la autoridad civil. Los críticos de arte consideran este monasterio como la joya del estilo manuelino y uno de los monumentos más importantes de Lisboa y Portugal. El interior es muy amplio y luminoso, con una sola nave de planta salón y una abigarrada decoración manuelina. La bóveda del crucero es grandiosa y cubre una superficie de 29 x 19 metros, sin apoyos centrales y con una compleja red de nervaduras. Fue diseñada por Juan de Castillo en 1522. La bóveda de la nave también fue diseñada por él y fue realizada en 1520. La Capilla mayor fue reformada posteriormente por el maestro Jerónimo Ruão en estilo renacentista avanzado con el mismo estilo que la capilla mayor de la iglesia del Monasterio de El Escorial. En el retablo destaca sobre todo el sagrario, pieza de orfebrería portuguesa del siglo XVIII de gran calidad. Es también de gran importancia el conjunto pictórico compuesto por unas tablas con el tema de la vida de Jesús. En esta capilla se encuentran apoyadas sobre leones las tumbas del rey Manuel I y su esposa María y de Joao III y Catarina de Austria.

El interior es muy amplio y luminoso, con una sola nave de planta salón y una abigarrada decoración manuelina. La bóveda del crucero es grandiosa y cubre una superficie de 29 x 19 metros, sin apoyos centrales y con una compleja red de nervaduras. Fue diseñada por Juan de Castillo en 1522. La bóveda de la nave también fue diseñada por él y fue realizada en 1520. La Capilla mayor fue reformada posteriormente por el maestro Jerónimo Ruão en estilo renacentista avanzado con el mismo estilo que la capilla mayor de la iglesia del Monasterio de El Escorial. En el retablo destaca sobre todo el sagrario, pieza de orfebrería portuguesa del siglo XVIII de gran calidad. Es también de gran importancia el conjunto pictórico compuesto por unas tablas con el tema de la vida de Jesús. En esta capilla se encuentran apoyadas sobre leones las tumbas del rey Manuel I y su esposa María y de Joao III y Catarina de Austria.

The monastery is one of the most prominent monuments of the Manueline-style architecture (Portuguese late-Gothic) in Lisbon, classified in 1983 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, along with the nearby Tower of Belém. The construction of the monastery and church began on 6 January 1501 (and were completed 100 years later). King Manuel originally funded the project with money obtained from the Vintena da Pimenta, a 5% tax on commerce from Africa and the Orient, equivalent to 70 kilograms (150 lb) of gold per year, with the exception of pepper, cinnamon and cloves (which went directly to the Crown. With the influx of riches, the architects were not limited to small plans, and resources already perscribed for the Monastery of Batalha (including the Aviz pantheon) were redirected to the project in Belém. Manuel I selected the religious order of Hieronymite monks to occupy the monastery, whose role it was to pray for the King's eternal soul and to provide spiritual assistance to navigators and sailors who departed from the beach of Restelo to discover the world.[2][1] This the monks did until 1833 (over four centuries), when the religious orders were dissolved and the monastery was unoccupied. The monastery was designed in a style that later became known as Manueline: a richly ornate architectural design that includes complex sculptural themes incorporating maritime elements and objects discovered during naval expeditions, carved in limestone. Diogo de Boitaca,[1] the architect, pioneered this style in the Monastery of Jesus in Setúbal. On this project Boitaca was responsible for the plans and contracting work on the monastery, the sacristy, and the refectory. He used calcário de lioz, a local gold-coloured limestone, that was quarried from Ajuda, the valley of Alcántara, Laveiras, Rio Seco and Tercena, for its construction. Boitaca was succeeded by the Spaniard Juan de Castilho, who took charge of construction around 1517. Castilho gradually moved from the Manueline to the Spanish Plateresque style, an ornamentation that included lavish decorations that recall silverware (Spanish: plata). The construction came to a halt when the King Manuel I died in 1521. There were several sculptors who made their mark on this building. Nicolau Chanterene added depth with hisRenaissance themes. The architect Diogo de Torralva resumed the construction of the monastery in 1550, adding the main chapel, the choir, and completing the two stories of the monastery, using only Renaissance motifs. Diogo de Torralva's work was continued in 1571 by Jérôme de Rouen (also called Jerónimo de Ruão) who added some Classical elements. The construction stopped in 1580 with the union of Spain and Portugal, because the building of the Escorial in Spain was now draining away all the funds. Diogo Boitac laid the foundations for this three-aisled church with five bays under a single vault, a clearly marked but only slightly projecting a transept and a raised choir. The hall church layout is composed of aisles and nave that are of equal height. Boitac built the walls of the church as far as the cornices and then started with the construction of the adjoining monastery. Juan de Castilho, a Spanish architect and sculptor, continued the construction in 1517. He completed the retaining walls and the unique single-span ribbed vault, a combination of stellar vaulting and tracery vaults spanning the 19 metre-wide church. Each set of ribs in the vaulting is secured by bosses. The bold design (1522) of the transversal vault of the transept lacks any piers or columns, while Boitac had originally planned three bays in the transept. The transept's unsupported vault gives the visitor the impression that it floats in the air. Castilho also decorated the six 25 metre-high, slender, articulated, octagonal columns with refined grotesque or floral elements typical of the Renaissance style. The construction of this late-Gothic hall is aesthetically and architecturally a masterwork: it augments the spatial effect of this vast building. The northern column closest to the transept there is a medallion that may have been intentionally included as a portrait of Boitac or Juan de Castilho. At the end of the side aisles and on both sides of the choir are altars (also in the Manueline-style) dating from the 16th and the 17th centuries. They are decorated with carved/sculpted wood and plated in golden and green pigment, one of which supports the image of Saint Jerome in multi-coloured enamelled terracotta. This chancel was ordered by Queen Catherine of Austria as the final resting place for the royal family. It is the work of Jerónimo de Ruão (Jean de Rouen) in the Classical style. The royal tombs rest on marble elephants and are set between Ionic pillars, topped by Corinthian pillars. The tombs on the left side of the choir belong to king Manuel I and his wife Maria of Aragon, while the tombs on the right side belong to King João III and his wife Queen Catherine of Austria.

<photo  date_taken="2011-12-07 12:17:47" description="&lt;b&gt;Out of range&lt;/b&gt; - Bairro de Belém - Lisboa (Portugal). &lt;b&gt;CASTELLANO&lt;/b&gt; El Monasterio de los Jerónimos de Santa María de Belém, se ubica en el barrio de Belém, Lisboa. Diseñado en estilo manuelino por el arquitecto Juan de Castillo, fue encargado por el rey Manuel I de Portugal para conmemorar el afortunado regreso de la India de Vasco de Gama, se fundó en 1501 en la antigua ermita fundada por el Infante D. Enrique. La primera etapa constructiva de la iglesia nueva comienza en 1514 y fue ampliándose y modificándose hasta el siglo XX. Se financió gracias al 5% de los impuestos obtenidos de las especias orientales, a excepción de los de la pimienta, la canela y el clavo, cuyas rentas iban directamente a la Corona. Este monasterio fue levantado sobre el enclave de la Ermida do Restelo en lo que fue la playa de Restelo, ermita fundada por Enrique el Navegante, y en la cual, Vasco de Gama y sus hombres pasaron la noche en oración antes de partir hacia la India. El estilo manuelino se caracteriza por la mezcla de motivos arquitectónicos y decorativos del gótico tardío y del renacimiento. Destacan los portales principal y lateral, el interior de la iglesia y el magnífico claustro. Las capillas de la iglesia fueron remodeladas en puro estilo renacentista en la segunda mitad del siglo XVI y contienen las arcas funerarias de Manuel I y su familia, además de otros reyes de Portugal. En los Jerónimos se hallan también las tumbas (neomanuelinas) del navegador Vasco da Gama y el poeta Luís de Camões. En una capilla del claustro descansan, desde 1985, los restos del escritor Fernando Pessoa. En un anexo construido en 1850 se ubica el Museo Nacional de Arqueología, el Museu da Marinha se encuentra en el ala oeste. En diciembre de 2007 se firmo en este monasterio el Tratado de Lisboa, un acuerdo de la Unión Europea que sustiyute la Constitución Europea y reforma los tratados que estaban vigentes. Este monasterio, al igual que la cercana Torre de Belém y el Monumento a los Descubrimientos simboliza la Era de las exploraciones portuguesa y se cuenta entre las principales atracciones turísticas de Lisboa. La primera etapa constructiva se encargó al arquitecto de origen francés, el maestro Diogo Boytac (o Boitaca), autor de la primitiva iglesia de Jesús de Setúbal. Su proyecto no fue llevado a cabo pues fue sustituido por el proyecto del siguiente arquitecto, Juan de Castillo. Boytac trabajó en el edificio en los años de 1514 y 1516. Planificó la obra siguiendo las normas imperantes del momento por toda Europa del gótico final. De esta etapa poco queda hoy. En 1516 le sucedió en las obras Juan de Castillo (en Portugal era conocido como João de Castilho). Juan de Castillo era de origen español según acredita un documento en que sus parientes dicen Juan de Castillo era natural de la Merindad de Trasmiera del reino de Castilla… concretamente de Castillo, pequeña localidad de la comarca de Trasmiera en Cantabria. Se sabe que trabajó en España hasta 1505. Con Castillo la obra comienza en su mayor diménsión y se corresponde con las mejores partes del edificio en estilo manuelino conjugándolo con el plateresco y estructuras renacentistas. Bajo su dirección se construyó la iglesia con las más osadas bóvedas, el claustro, la sacristía, la sala capitular y el refectorio. A la muerte del rey Manuel (1521) las obras no se paralizaron y continuarón en tiempos del rey Juan III, hasta que más tarde continuaron con el arquitecto español Diego de Torralva en 1544. La fecha aparece grabada en la piedra. La diferencia de estilo de este arquitecto con respecto al los anteriores se muestra sobre todo en el gran friso alto realizado por Diego de la Zarza y en la introducción de los medallones vueltos de lado. El monasterio fue confiado a los jerónimos, que estuvieron en él hasta 1833 en que fueron expulsados por la autoridad civil. La portada meridional fue diseñada por el arquitecto Juan de Castillo que se inspiró en el estilo tardogótico aun vigente con la introducción de la decoración plateresca y elementos renacentistas. Está dividida verticalmente en dos cuerpos. El de abajo consta de un gran arco conopial que cobija dos puertas de acceso. En el tímpano se pueden ver unos bajorrelieves con representaciones de la vida de san Jerónimo y el escudo portugués. El arco está rematado por una escultura de la Virgen de Belém. La parte superior presenta una ventana de arco de medio punto.

The construction stopped in 1580 with the union of Spain and Portugal, because the building of the Escorial in Spain was now draining away all the funds. The ornate side entrance to the monastery was designed by Juan de Castilho and is considered one of the most significant of his time, but is not, in fact, the main entrance to the building. This shrine-like portal is large, 32 metre high and 12 metre wide, extending two stories. Its ornate features includes an abundance of gables and pinnacles, with many carved figures standing under a baldachin in carved niches, around a statue of Henry the Navigator, standing on a pedestal between the two doors. The tympanum, above the double door, displays, in half-relief, two scenes from the life of Saint Jerome: on the left, the removal of the thorn from the lion's paw and, on the right, the saints experience in the desert. In the spandrel between these scenes is the coat-of-arms of king Manuel I, while the archivolt and tympanum are covered in Manueline symbols and elements. The Madonna (Santa Maria de Belém) is located on a pedestal on top of the archivolt, surmounted by the archangel Michael, while above the portal there is a cross of the Order of Christ. The portal is harmoniously flanked on each side by a large window with richly decorated mouldings.

Con Castillo la obra comienza en su mayor diménsión y se corresponde con las mejores partes del edificio en estilo manuelino conjugándolo con el plateresco y estructuras renacentistas. Bajo su dirección se construyó la iglesia con las más osadas bóvedas, el claustro, la sacristía, la sala capitular y el refectorio. A la muerte del rey Manuel (1521) las obras no se paralizaron y continuarón en tiempos del rey Juan III, hasta que más tarde continuaron con el arquitecto español Diego de Torralva en 1544. La fecha aparece grabada en la piedra. La diferencia de estilo de este arquitecto con respecto al los anteriores se muestra sobre todo en el gran friso alto realizado por Diego de la Zarza y en la introducción de los medallones vueltos de lado. El monasterio fue confiado a los jerónimos, que estuvieron en él hasta 1833 en que fueron expulsados por la autoridad civil. El claustro se encuentra situado junto a la nave norte del templo. Fue diseñado por Juan de Castillo. Fue realizado entre 1517 y 1519 con varias contratas y subcontratas dando lugar a un resultado final de armonía y uniformidad. Todo el claustro está ampliamente decorado con motivos manuelinos (letra M, esfera armilar, cabos marineros, temas religiosos, hornacinas, medallones, etc.). Desde el piso de arriba se puede acceder al coro alto de la iglesia, que fue construido por Torralva en el siglo XVI. En él se halla una importante sillería también del XVI.

The monastery is one of the most prominent monuments of the Manueline-style architecture (Portuguese late-Gothic) in Lisbon, classified in 1983 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, along with the nearby Tower of Belém. The construction of the monastery and church began on 6 January 1501 (and were completed 100 years later). King Manuel originally funded the project with money obtained from the Vintena da Pimenta, a 5% tax on commerce from Africa and the Orient, equivalent to 70 kilograms (150 lb) of gold per year, with the exception of pepper, cinnamon and cloves (which went directly to the Crown. With the influx of riches, the architects were not limited to small plans, and resources already perscribed for the Monastery of Batalha (including the Aviz pantheon) were redirected to the project in Belém. Manuel I selected the religious order of Hieronymite monks to occupy the monastery, whose role it was to pray for the King's eternal soul and to provide spiritual assistance to navigators and sailors who departed from the beach of Restelo to discover the world.[2][1] This the monks did until 1833 (over four centuries), when the religious orders were dissolved and the monastery was unoccupied. The monastery was designed in a style that later became known as Manueline: a richly ornate architectural design that includes complex sculptural themes incorporating maritime elements and objects discovered during naval expeditions, carved in limestone. Diogo de Boitaca,[1] the architect, pioneered this style in the Monastery of Jesus in Setúbal. On this project Boitaca was responsible for the plans and contracting work on the monastery, the sacristy, and the refectory. He used calcário de lioz, a local gold-coloured limestone, that was quarried from Ajuda, the valley of Alcántara, Laveiras, Rio Seco and Tercena, for its construction. Boitaca was succeeded by the Spaniard Juan de Castilho, who took charge of construction around 1517. Castilho gradually moved from the Manueline to the Spanish Plateresque style, an ornamentation that included lavish decorations that recall silverware (Spanish: plata). The construction came to a halt when the King Manuel I died in 1521. There were several sculptors who made their mark on this building. Nicolau Chanterene added depth with hisRenaissance themes. The architect Diogo de Torralva resumed the construction of the monastery in 1550, adding the main chapel, the choir, and completing the two stories of the monastery, using only Renaissance motifs. Diogo de Torralva's work was continued in 1571 by Jérôme de Rouen (also called Jerónimo de Ruão) who added some Classical elements. The construction stopped in 1580 with the union of Spain and Portugal, because the building of the Escorial in Spain was now draining away all the funds. Work on the vast square cloister (55 x 55 m) of the monastery was begun by Boitac. He built the groin vaults with wide arches and windows with tracery resting on delicate mullions. Juan de Castilho finished the construction by giving the lower storey a classical overlay and building a more recessed upper-storey. The construction of such a cloister was a novelty at the time. Castilho changed the original round columns of Boitac into rectangular ones, and embellished it with Plateresque-style ornamentation. Each wing consists of six bays with tracery vaults. The four inner bays rest on massive buttresses, forming broad arcades. The corner bays are linked by a diagonal arched construction and show the richly decorated corner pillars. The cloister had a religious function as well as a representative function by its decorative ornamentation and the dynastic symbolic motives, such as the armillarium, coat-of-arms, and the cross from the Order of Christ, showing the growing world power of Portugal. The inside walls of the cloister have a wealth of Manueline motives with nautical elements, in addition to European, Moorish and Eastern motifs. The round arches and the horizontal structure are clearly in line with the Renaissance style, while at the same time there is also a relationship with Spanish architecture. The decorations on the outer walls of the inner courtyard were made in Plateresco style by Castilho: the arcades include traceried arches that give the construction a filigree aspect.

Diseñado en estilo manuelino por el arquitecto Juan de Castillo, fue encargado por el rey Manuel I de Portugal para conmemorar el afortunado regreso de la India de Vasco de Gama, se fundó en 1501 en la antigua ermita fundada por el Infante D. Enrique. La primera etapa constructiva de la iglesia nueva comienza en 1514 y fue ampliándose y modificándose hasta el siglo XX. Se financió gracias al 5% de los impuestos obtenidos de las especias orientales, a excepción de los de la pimienta, la canela y el clavo, cuyas rentas iban directamente a la Corona. Este monasterio fue levantado sobre el enclave de la Ermida do Restelo en lo que fue la playa de Restelo, ermita fundada por Enrique el Navegante, y en la cual, Vasco de Gama y sus hombres pasaron la noche en oración antes de partir hacia la India. El estilo manuelino se caracteriza por la mezcla de motivos arquitectónicos y decorativos del gótico tardío y del renacimiento. Destacan los portales principal y lateral, el interior de la iglesia y el magnífico claustro. Las capillas de la iglesia fueron remodeladas en puro estilo renacentista en la segunda mitad del siglo XVI y contienen las arcas funerarias de Manuel I y su familia, además de otros reyes de Portugal. En los Jerónimos se hallan también las tumbas (neomanuelinas) del navegador Vasco da Gama y el poeta Luís de Camões. En una capilla del claustro descansan, desde 1985, los restos del escritor Fernando Pessoa. En un anexo construido en 1850 se ubica el Museo Nacional de Arqueología, el Museu da Marinha se encuentra en el ala oeste. En diciembre de 2007 se firmo en este monasterio el Tratado de Lisboa, un acuerdo de la Unión Europea que sustiyute la Constitución Europea y reforma los tratados que estaban vigentes. Este monasterio, al igual que la cercana Torre de Belém y el Monumento a los Descubrimientos simboliza la Era de las exploraciones portuguesa y se cuenta entre las principales atracciones turísticas de Lisboa. La primera etapa constructiva se encargó al arquitecto de origen francés, el maestro Diogo Boytac (o Boitaca), autor de la primitiva iglesia de Jesús de Setúbal. Su proyecto no fue llevado a cabo pues fue sustituido por el proyecto del siguiente arquitecto, Juan de Castillo. Boytac trabajó en el edificio en los años de 1514 y 1516. Planificó la obra siguiendo las normas imperantes del momento por toda Europa del gótico final. De esta etapa poco queda hoy. En 1516 le sucedió en las obras Juan de Castillo (en Portugal era conocido como João de Castilho). Juan de Castillo era de origen español según acredita un documento en que sus parientes dicen Juan de Castillo era natural de la Merindad de Trasmiera del reino de Castilla… concretamente de Castillo, pequeña localidad de la comarca de Trasmiera en Cantabria.

<photo  date_taken="2013-02-06 07:26:09" description="Essentially serving the purpose of isolation for the monastic community, the Cloister was an agreeable and serene place for prayer, meditation and leisure for the monks of the Hieronymite Order. Designed by Diogo de Boitaca, who commenced the work in the early 16th century, it was continued by João de Castilho from 1517 onwards and completed by Diogo de Torralva in 1540-1541. Due to its significance and symbolism, the Cloister is today one of the most important examples of Manueline architecture. With two storeys, vaulted ceilings and quadrangular layout, its decoration showcases the originality of this style by combining religious symbols (images from the Passion, amongst others), royal imagery (the Cross of the Order of Christ, the armillary sphere, the royal coat of arms) and naturalist elements (ropes and plant-inspired motifs that cohabit with late Mediaeval imagery of fantastic animals). In the north wing of the lower cloister is the tomb of Fernando Pessoa, created by Lagoa Henriques in 1985.

The existing structure was started on the orders of Manuel I (1515-1520) to commemorate Vasco da Gama's successful return from India. It was originally meant as a church for the burial of the House of Aviz, but it also became a house of prayer for seamen leaving or entering port.

He built the church, the monastery, the sacristy and the refectory. He was succeeded by the Spaniard João de Castilho, who took charge of construction in around 1517.

His work was continued in 1571 by Jérôme de Rouen (also called Jerónimo de Ruão) who added some Classical elements. The construction stopped in 1580 with the union of Spain and Portugal, because the building of the Escorial in Spain was now draining away all the funds. The monastery withstood the Great Earthquake of 1755 without too much damage.

It was originally meant as a church for the burial of the House of Aviz, but it also became a house of prayer for seamen leaving or entering port. Construction of the monastery began in 1502 and took 50 years to complete. He used pedra lioz, a local gold-coloured limestone, for its construction. The building of the monastery was funded by a 5% tax on eastern spices, with the exceptions of pepper, cinnamon and cloves, revenue from which went straight to the Crown. By this influx of riches, the architects had enough financial margin to think big. The enormous amount of funds needed for this monastery, meant abandoning the construction of the Aviz pantheon in the Monastery of Batalha. The monastery was designed in the Manueline style by Diogo de Boitaca (who was probably one of the originators of this style with the Igreja de Jesus in Setúbal). He built the church, the monastery, the sacristy and the refectory. He was succeeded by the Spaniard João de Castilho, who took charge of construction in around 1517. João de Castilho gradually moved from the Manueline style to the Plateresco style, a style with lavish decorations that remind of silver ware (plata = silver). There were several sculptors who made their mark on this building. Nicolau Chanterene added depth with his Renaissance themes. The construction came to a halt when the king Manuel I died in 1520. The architect Diogo de Torralva resumed the construction of the monastery in 1550, adding the main chapel, the choir and completing the two storeys of the monastery, using only Renaissance motifs. His work was continued in 1571 by Jérôme de Rouen (also called Jerónimo de Ruão) who added some Classical elements. The construction stopped in 1580 with the union of Spain and Portugal, because the building of the Escorial in Spain was now draining away all the funds. The monastery withstood the Great Earthquake of 1755 without too much damage. But when the building became vacant in 1833 by the abolition of the religious orders in Portugal, it began to deteriorate to the point of almost collapsing. A cupola was later added to the southwestern tower.

The monastery was designed in the Manueline style by Diogo de Boitaca (who was probably one of the originators of this style with the Igreja de Jesus in Setúbal). He built the church, the monastery, the sacristy and the refectory. He was succeeded by the Spaniard João de Castilho, who took charge of construction in around 1517. João de Castilho gradually moved from the Manueline style to the Plateresco style, a style with lavish decorations that remind of silver ware (plata = silver). There were several sculptors who made their mark on this building. Nicolau Chanterene added depth with his Renaissance themes. The construction came to a halt when the king Manuel I died in 1520. The architect Diogo de Torralva resumed the construction of the monastery in 1550, adding the main chapel, the choir and completing the two storeys of the monastery, using only Renaissance motifs. His work was continued in 1571 by Jérôme de Rouen (also called Jerónimo de Ruão) who added some Classical elements. The construction stopped in 1580 with the union of Spain and Portugal, because the building of the Escorial in Spain was now draining away all the funds. The monastery withstood the Great Earthquake of 1755 without too much damage.

This magnificent monastery can be considered one of the most prominent monuments in Lisbon and is certainly one of the most successful achievements of the Manueline style (Portuguese late-Gothic). In 1983 it was classified by the UNESCO, with nearby Torre de Belém, as a World Heritage Site. The house for the Hieronymite monks was built on the same site of the Ermida do Restelo, a hermitage that was founded by Henry the Navigator at about 1450. It was at this hermitage, that was already in disrepair, that Vasco da Gama and his men spent the night in prayer before departing for India in 1497. The existing structure was started on the orders of Manuel I (1515-1520) to commemorate Vasco da Gama's successful return from India. It was originally meant as a church for the burial of the House of Aviz, but it also became a house of prayer for seamen leaving or entering port. Construction of the monastery began in 1502 and took 50 years to complete. He used pedra lioz, a local gold-coloured limestone, for its construction. The building of the monastery was funded by a 5% tax on eastern spices, with the exceptions of pepper, cinnamon and cloves, revenue from which went straight to the Crown. By this influx of riches, the architects had enough financial margin to think big. The enormous amount of funds needed for this monastery, meant abandoning the construction of the Aviz pantheon in the Monastery of Batalha. The monastery was designed in the Manueline style by Diogo de Boitaca (who was probably one of the originators of this style with the Igreja de Jesus in Setúbal). He built the church, the monastery, the sacristy and the refectory. He was succeeded by the Spaniard João de Castilho, who took charge of construction in around 1517. João de Castilho gradually moved from the Manueline style to the Plateresco style, a style with lavish decorations that remind of silver ware (plata = silver). There were several sculptors who made their mark on this building. Nicolau Chanterene added depth with his Renaissance themes. The construction came to a halt when the king Manuel I died in 1520. The architect Diogo de Torralva resumed the construction of the monastery in 1550, adding the main chapel, the choir and completing the two storeys of the monastery, using only Renaissance motifs. His work was continued in 1571 by Jérôme de Rouen (also called Jerónimo de Ruão) who added some Classical elements. The construction stopped in 1580 with the union of Spain and Portugal, because the building of the Escorial in Spain was now draining away all the funds.

In 1983 it was classified by the UNESCO, with nearby Torre de Belém, as a World Heritage Site. The house for the Hieronymite monks was built on the same site of the Ermida do Restelo, a hermitage that was founded by Henry the Navigator at about 1450. It was at this hermitage, that was already in disrepair, that Vasco da Gama and his men spent the night in prayer before departing for India in 1497. The existing structure was started on the orders of Manuel I (1515-1520) to commemorate Vasco da Gama's successful return from India. It was originally meant as a church for the burial of the House of Aviz, but it also became a house of prayer for seamen leaving or entering port. Construction of the monastery began in 1502 and took 50 years to complete. He used pedra lioz, a local gold-coloured limestone, for its construction. The building of the monastery was funded by a 5% tax on eastern spices, with the exceptions of pepper, cinnamon and cloves, revenue from which went straight to the Crown. By this influx of riches, the architects had enough financial margin to think big. The enormous amount of funds needed for this monastery, meant abandoning the construction of the Aviz pantheon in the Monastery of Batalha. The monastery was designed in the Manueline style by Diogo de Boitaca (who was probably one of the originators of this style with the Igreja de Jesus in Setúbal). He built the church, the monastery, the sacristy and the refectory. He was succeeded by the Spaniard João de Castilho, who took charge of construction in around 1517. João de Castilho gradually moved from the Manueline style to the Plateresco style, a style with lavish decorations that remind of silver ware (plata = silver). There were several sculptors who made their mark on this building. Nicolau Chanterene added depth with his Renaissance themes. The construction came to a halt when the king Manuel I died in 1520. The architect Diogo de Torralva resumed the construction of the monastery in 1550, adding the main chapel, the choir and completing the two storeys of the monastery, using only Renaissance motifs. His work was continued in 1571 by Jérôme de Rouen (also called Jerónimo de Ruão) who added some Classical elements. The construction stopped in 1580 with the union of Spain and Portugal, because the building of the Escorial in Spain was now draining away all the funds. The monastery withstood the Great Earthquake of 1755 without too much damage. But when the building became vacant in 1833 by the abolition of the religious orders in Portugal, it began to deteriorate to the point of almost collapsing. A cupola was later added to the southwestern tower. On December 13, 2007 the Treaty of Lisbon has been signed at the monastery, laying down the basis for the reform of the European Union." id="3977013644" latitude="0" license="5" longitude="0" nbComments="0" rank="85" tags="lissabon 20090911 mosteirodosjerónimos canonpowershota2100is lisbon lisboa portugal 2009 mlf" title="Mosteiro dos Jerónimos" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/2615/3977013644_32dde380d3_b.jpg" username="Morgaine" views="242" />

Era para ser uma conexão rápida, mas mudaram o horário do vôo para o Brasil e a gente teve que esperar umas 6 horas no aeroporto. Então resolvemos fazer um city tour. &lt;i&gt;O Mosteiro dos Jerónimos é um mosteiro manuelino, testemunho monumental da riqueza dos Descobrimentos portugueses. Situa-se em Belém, Lisboa, à entrada do Rio Tejo. Constitui o ponto mais alto da arquitectura manuelina e o mais notável conjunto monástico do século XVI em Portugal e uma das principais igrejas-salão da Europa. Destacam-se o seu claustro, completo em 1544, e a porta sul, de complexo desenho geométrico, virada para o rio Tejo. Os elementos decorativos são repletos de símbolos da arte da navegação e de esculturas de plantas e animais exóticos. O monumento é considerado património mundial pela UNESCO, e em 7 de Julho de 2007 foi eleito como uma das sete maravilhas de Portugal.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosteiro_dos_Jer%c3%b4nimos&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipédia&lt;/a&gt; Nota: Em português de Portugal, o nome correto é Mosteiro dos Jerónimos, mas no português do Brasil, fica Mosteiro dos Jerônimos.
