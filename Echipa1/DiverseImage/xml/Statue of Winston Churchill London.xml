<photo  date_taken="2006-11-09 11:41:26" description="The massive Parliament Square statue, The Churchill, erected in 1973 by Ivor Roberts-Jones, depicts a brooding Winston Churchill. The 12-foot bronze statue atop an 8-foot plinth looks east towards &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/299908721/&quot;&gt;Big Ben&lt;/a&gt;. Sir Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill (1874 – 1965) was best known as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom during the WWII. He won the 1953 Nobel Prize in Literature for his many books on English and world history. Sir Winston Churchill was voted the greatest-ever Briton in the 2002 BBC poll the 100 Greatest Britons. Parliament Square is a square outside the north-western end of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/299909312/&quot;&gt;Palace of Westminster&lt;/a&gt;. It was laid out in 1868 by Sir Charles Barry in order to open up the space around the Palace and improve traffic flow, and featured London's first traffic signals. Its original features included the Buxton Memorial Fountain, which was removed in 1940 and placed in its present position in nearby Victoria Tower Gardens in 1957. In 1950 the square was redesigned by George Grey Wornum. The east side of the Square, lying opposite one of the key entrances to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/300150850/&quot;&gt;Palace of Westminster&lt;/a&gt;, has historically been a common site of protest against government action or inaction.

This picture of Big Ben was taken on an overcast day in Spring in London, in the run up to the 2010 UK elections. I took a few standard shots of Big Ben and then started to wander around the central square trying to pick a new angle on the famous tower with its bell that chimes every hour. I spotted the murky puddle and by shuffling my position, found that it reflected Big Ben quite nicely. It was also a convenient horizontal shape to it, reflecting Big Ben's tower. After some test pictures, I was excited to find that there were some lines leading straight towards the Big Ben tower created naturally from the grass verge to one side. More challenging, I couldn't work out how to fit both Big Ben and its reflection into one photograph. I tried tilting the camera, but I couldn't cram it all in and keep the reflection in my lens. I decided to compromise by cutting off the top of the real Big Ben tower. I went down as far as the Churchill statue. I realised that there were intermittent London Red Buses trawling along Parliament Square, so timed my shot to get one of these splitting the frame. If I had a tripod I would have gone for a bit more motion blur here but I will have to live with the bit I took. Despite the overcast sky, I managed to find a tiny bit of blue in the sky, which I positioned by the reflected clock face of Big Ben. Some branches help remind me that this is a puddle rather than a fancy photoshop effect. Then I took the picture. Back at home, in Aperture, I realised that by flipping the picture 180 degrees, your eye would recognise Big Ben, and run down the page trying to make sense of what it was seeing. A bit of fun for a most iconic of buildings - Big Ben in London. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Big Ben is the nickname for the great bell of the clock at the north end of the Palace of Westminster in London, and is often extended to refer to the clock or the clock tower as well. Big Ben is the largest four-faced chiming clock and the third-tallest free-standing clock tower in the world. It celebrated its 150th anniversary in May 2009 (the clock itself first ticking on 31 May 1859), during which celebratory events took place.

<photo  date_taken="2006-11-09 11:40:13" description="The Parliament Square statue, The Palmsterson, erected in 1869 by Pre-Raphaelite sculptor Thomas Woolner, is perhaps the most important figure in the square in terms of sculptural interest. The figure is naturalistic in pose with Lord Palmerston's hand held out as if in conversation. Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston, (1784 – 1865) was a British statesman who served twice as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in the mid-19th century. He was in government office almost continuously from 1807 until his death in 1865, beginning his parliamentary career as a Tory and concluding it as a Liberal. He is best remembered for his direction of British foreign policy through a period when the United Kingdom was at the height of its power, serving terms as both Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister. British born Woolner (1825-1892) was both sculptor and poet, and a founding member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. Woolner trained with the sculptor William Behnes, exhibiting work at the Royal Academy from 1843.

Westminster Hall is the only part of the original Palace to survive the fire of 1834 and was incorporated into Sir Charles Barry's Perpendicur Gothic design of the new palace. The Hall is marked by Hamo Thornycroft's 1899 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/301431025&quot;&gt;statue of Oliver Cromwell&lt;/a&gt;--it was here that he was sworn in as Lord Protector in 1643, and Marochetti's 1860 statue of Richard the Lionheart (pictured here)--seated on his horse, sword raised. The roof of the Hall was originally supported by pillars but, during the reign of King Richard II, it was replaced by a hammerbeam roof designed by Henry Yevele and Hugh Herland. Westminster Hall is one of the largest halls in Europe with an unsupported roof, measuring 21x73m (68x240'). Although originally designed as a banquet hall, it came to be used primarily for judicial purposes, housing three of the most important courts in the land--the Court of King's Bench, the Court of Common Pleas, and the Court of Chancery--until they moved to the Royal Courts of Justice in 1882. It was here that the impeachment trial of Charles I after the Civil War, and the treason trials of Anne Boleyna, William Wallace and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/305373294/&quot;&gt;Guy Fawkes&lt;/a&gt; were held. From the 12th to 19th centuries, coronation banquets were held here, the last belonging to King George IV (1821). Today Westminster Hall is used for lyings-in-state, usually reserved for the Sovereign and their consorts. The only non-royals to receive one in the 20th century were Frederick Sleigh Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts (1914) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/299906121/&quot;&gt;Sir Winston Churchill&lt;/a&gt; (1965).

<photo  date_taken="2010-05-01 10:09:39" description="&lt;b&gt;The Dorchester is a luxury hotel on Park Lane in Mayfair, London, overlooking Hyde Park. The Dorchester Hotel opened on 18 April 1931. It was created by Sir Malcolm McAlpine and Sir Frances Towle. In 1929, they bought the old Dorchester House, a large 19th century building, and quickly had it demolished. Sir Owen Williams was commissioned to design the new hotel. In the new edifice, the use of reinforced concrete allowed the creation of large internal spaces without support pillars. The construction, which was carried out by Sir Robert McAlpine,[1] was completed in 1931. In World War II, its modern construction gave the hotel a reputation of being a very safe building. Cabinet Ministers such as Lord Halifax and Duff Cooper stayed there during this time. General Dwight D. Eisenhower arrived in 1942 after staying at Claridge's and stayed on the first floor (now the Eisenhower Suite). Winston Churchill had a wall built to add privacy to his balcony and it still exists today. Diners at the Dorchester from cultural circles during this period included Cyril Connolly, T. S. Eliot, Harold Nicolson and Edith Sitwell. In 1988, the hotel closed for two years for a major refit. The hotel was completely updated and the Promenade, Grill Room and the Oliver Messel Suite were meticulously restored, to reopen in 1990.

<photo  date_taken="2010-05-01 10:03:22" description="&lt;b&gt;The Dorchester is a luxury hotel on Park Lane in Mayfair, London, overlooking Hyde Park. The Dorchester Hotel opened on 18 April 1931. It was created by Sir Malcolm McAlpine and Sir Frances Towle. In 1929, they bought the old Dorchester House, a large 19th century building, and quickly had it demolished. Sir Owen Williams was commissioned to design the new hotel. In the new edifice, the use of reinforced concrete allowed the creation of large internal spaces without support pillars. The construction, which was carried out by Sir Robert McAlpine,[1] was completed in 1931. In World War II, its modern construction gave the hotel a reputation of being a very safe building. Cabinet Ministers such as Lord Halifax and Duff Cooper stayed there during this time. General Dwight D. Eisenhower arrived in 1942 after staying at Claridge's and stayed on the first floor (now the Eisenhower Suite). Winston Churchill had a wall built to add privacy to his balcony and it still exists today. Diners at the Dorchester from cultural circles during this period included Cyril Connolly, T. S. Eliot, Harold Nicolson and Edith Sitwell. In 1988, the hotel closed for two years for a major refit. The hotel was completely updated and the Promenade, Grill Room and the Oliver Messel Suite were meticulously restored, to reopen in 1990. The Dorchester is managed and owned by the Dorchester Collection; a collection of seven luxury hotels in the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Italy. It was organized in 1996 to manage the hotel interests of the Brunei Investment Agency. High profile celebrities that have stayed at the Dorchester over the years have included[citation needed] : Britney Spears, Julie Andrews, Kim Basinger, Warren Beatty, Yul Brynner, Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, Mariah Carey, Tom Cruise, Judy Garland, Johnny Depp, Dame Edna Everage, Russell Crowe, Charlton Heston, Nicole Kidman, Joan Collins, James Mason, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Peter Sellers and Kenneth Horne (who died in the hotel).

<photo  date_taken="2010-05-01 11:04:13" description="&lt;b&gt;The Dorchester is a luxury hotel on Park Lane in Mayfair, London, overlooking Hyde Park. The Dorchester Hotel opened on 18 April 1931. It was created by Sir Malcolm McAlpine and Sir Frances Towle. In 1929, they bought the old Dorchester House, a large 19th century building, and quickly had it demolished. Sir Owen Williams was commissioned to design the new hotel. In the new edifice, the use of reinforced concrete allowed the creation of large internal spaces without support pillars. The construction, which was carried out by Sir Robert McAlpine,[1] was completed in 1931. In World War II, its modern construction gave the hotel a reputation of being a very safe building. Cabinet Ministers such as Lord Halifax and Duff Cooper stayed there during this time. General Dwight D. Eisenhower arrived in 1942 after staying at Claridge's and stayed on the first floor (now the Eisenhower Suite). Winston Churchill had a wall built to add privacy to his balcony and it still exists today. Diners at the Dorchester from cultural circles during this period included Cyril Connolly, T. S. Eliot, Harold Nicolson and Edith Sitwell. In 1988, the hotel closed for two years for a major refit. The hotel was completely updated and the Promenade, Grill Room and the Oliver Messel Suite were meticulously restored, to reopen in 1990. The Dorchester is managed and owned by the Dorchester Collection; a collection of seven luxury hotels in the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Italy. It was organized in 1996 to manage the hotel interests of the Brunei Investment Agency. High profile celebrities that have stayed at the Dorchester over the years have included[citation needed] : Britney Spears, Julie Andrews, Kim Basinger, Warren Beatty, Yul Brynner, Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, Mariah Carey, Tom Cruise, Judy Garland, Johnny Depp, Dame Edna Everage, Russell Crowe, Charlton Heston, Nicole Kidman, Joan Collins, James Mason, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Peter Sellers and Kenneth Horne (who died in the hotel).

<photo  date_taken="2010-05-01 09:51:17" description="&lt;b&gt;The Dorchester is a luxury hotel on Park Lane in Mayfair, London, overlooking Hyde Park. The Dorchester Hotel opened on 18 April 1931. It was created by Sir Malcolm McAlpine and Sir Frances Towle. In 1929, they bought the old Dorchester House, a large 19th century building, and quickly had it demolished. Sir Owen Williams was commissioned to design the new hotel. In the new edifice, the use of reinforced concrete allowed the creation of large internal spaces without support pillars. The construction, which was carried out by Sir Robert McAlpine,[1] was completed in 1931. In World War II, its modern construction gave the hotel a reputation of being a very safe building. Cabinet Ministers such as Lord Halifax and Duff Cooper stayed there during this time. General Dwight D. Eisenhower arrived in 1942 after staying at Claridge's and stayed on the first floor (now the Eisenhower Suite). Winston Churchill had a wall built to add privacy to his balcony and it still exists today. Diners at the Dorchester from cultural circles during this period included Cyril Connolly, T. S. Eliot, Harold Nicolson and Edith Sitwell. In 1988, the hotel closed for two years for a major refit. The hotel was completely updated and the Promenade, Grill Room and the Oliver Messel Suite were meticulously restored, to reopen in 1990. The Dorchester is managed and owned by the Dorchester Collection; a collection of seven luxury hotels in the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Italy. It was organized in 1996 to manage the hotel interests of the Brunei Investment Agency. High profile celebrities that have stayed at the Dorchester over the years have included[citation needed] : Britney Spears, Julie Andrews, Kim Basinger, Warren Beatty, Yul Brynner, Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, Mariah Carey, Tom Cruise, Judy Garland, Johnny Depp, Dame Edna Everage, Russell Crowe, Charlton Heston, Nicole Kidman, Joan Collins, James Mason, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Peter Sellers and Kenneth Horne (who died in the hotel).

<photo  date_taken="2008-06-10 18:54:18" description="Grand Palais is a large, richly ornamented exhibition hall built of cast-iron and glass between 1897 and 1900 for the 1900 Paris Exhibition, at the same time when Pont Alexandre III (in front with the four columns topped by goldened statues) and Petit Palais (the facing building across avenue Winston Churchill [named after Nicholas II, son of Alexandre III in time of erecting], not displayed on this) were also constructed. It is a work of a team of architects including Henri-Adolphe-Auguste Deglane, Louis-Albert Louvet, Albert-Félix-Théophile Thomas and Charles-Louis Girault. The stone facades allude to Classical architecture, while the iron &amp;amp; glass work can be clearly indentified as Art Noveau. (Grand Palais was presumably inspired by Joseph Paxton's Crystal Palace, originally erected in Hyde Park, London, in 1851, also for housing a Great Exhibition - but that one was removed from its original location after six months, and was enlarged and re-built again two years later on the area which is named after it nowadays; Queen Victoria could open it twice within two years. Unfortunately, that building was completely demolished by a fire in 1936, so the closest living London relative of Grand Palais is Alexandra Palace today; although also injured. But that's only a side story to this.) Grand Palais construction works were executed by Daydé &amp;amp; Pillé, a construction enterprise founded in 1880 and active as far as the 1960s. In 1975 the building was acknowledged as a historical heritage site. From 1993 to 2005 it was closed, and refurbished thoroughly and in an extremely nice way.

Sir Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill (1874 – 1965) was best known as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom during the WWII. He won the 1953 Nobel Prize in Literature for his many books on English and world history. Sir Winston Churchill was voted the greatest-ever Briton in the 2002 BBC poll the 100 Greatest Britons. Parliament Square is a square outside the north-western end of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/300146847/&quot;&gt;Palace of Westminster&lt;/a&gt;. It was laid out in 1868 by Sir Charles Barry in order to open up the space around the Palace and improve traffic flow, and featured London's first traffic signals. Its original features included the Buxton Memorial Fountain, which was removed in 1940 and placed in its present position in nearby Victoria Tower Gardens in 1957. In 1950 the square was redesigned by George Grey Wornum. The east side of the Square, lying opposite one of the key entrances to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/300150850/&quot;&gt;Palace of Westminster&lt;/a&gt;, has historically been a common site of protest against government action or inaction.

<photo  date_taken="2006-11-09 11:41:12" description="The massive Parliament Square statue, The Churchill, erected in 1973 by Ivor Roberts-Jones, depicts a brooding Winston Churchill. The 12-foot bronze statue atop an 8-foot plinth looks east towards Big Ben. Sir Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill (1874 – 1965) was best known as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom during the WWII. The Clock Tower is a turret clock structure at the north-eastern end of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/299909312/&quot;&gt;Houses of Parliament&lt;/a&gt; building. It is colloquially known as Big Ben, however this name actually belongs to the clock's main bell. The tower was raised as a part of Charles Barry's design of a new palace, after the old Palace of Westminster was destroyed by fire on October 16, 1834. The tower is designed in the Victorian Gothic style, and is 96.3m (316') high. The first 61m (200') of the structure is the clock tower, consisting of brickwork with stone cladding; the remainder is a framed spire of cast iron. The tower is founded on a 15m x 15m (49' x 49') raft, made of 3m (9') thick concrete, at a depth of 7m (23') below ground level. The tower has an estimated weight of 8,667 tonnes (9,553 tons). Due to ground conditions, the actually tower leans slightly to the north-west, by roughly 220mm (8.66&amp;quot;). The four clock faces are 55m (180') above ground. They were once large enough to allow the Clock Tower to be the largest four-faced clock in the world, but has since been outdone by the Allen-Bradley Clock Tower in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Great Clock of Westminster still holds the title of the &amp;quot;World's largest four-faced chiming clock&amp;quot;, though. The hour hand is 9' long and the minute hand is 14' long. The clock faces and dials were designed by Augustus Pugin. The faces are set in an iron framework 7m (21') in diameter supporting 576 pieces of opal glass. The surround of the dials is heavily gilded. At the base of each clock face in gilt letters is the Latin inscription 'DOMINE SALVAM FAC REGINAM NOSTRAM VICTORIAM PRIMAM' meaning 'Lord save our Queen Victoria I'. The clock mechanism itself was completed by 1854, but the tower was not fully constructed until four years later in 1858. The clock became operational on September 7, 1859. Big Ben, officially known as the Great Bell of Westminster, is the largest bell in the tower. Cast in 1856 in Stockton-on-Tees by George Meers, it cracked under the striking hammer while mounted in New Palace Yard. It was recast at Whitechapel Bell Foundry as the the 12.5 tonne (13.8 ton) bell which is in use today. Installed into the clock tower in 1908, another crack formed. To prevent further damage to the bell it was rotated and the main hammer was reduced in weight. The origin of the name 'Big Ben' has remained a popular mystery, leading to speculation it was named after heavyweight boxer Benjamin Caunt. A more populate alternate theory says it was named after Sir Benjamin Hall, who was the Parliamentary Commissioner of Works. The BBC first broadcast the &amp;quot;E&amp;quot; note chimes on December 31, 1923. Along with the main bell, the belfry houses four quarter bells which play the Westminster Quarters on the quarter hours. The four quarter bells are G sharp, F sharp, E, and B. They play a 20 chime sequence, 1-4 at quarter past, 5-12 at half past, 13-20,1-4 at quarter to, and 5-20 on the hour. Because the low bell (B) is struck twice in quick succession, there is not enough time to pull a hammer back, and it is supplied with two hammers on opposite sides. The clock is famous for its reliability, due in large part to the experimentation by designer, lawyer and amateur horologist Edmund Beckett Denison, later Lord Grimthorpe. As the clock mechanism, created to Denison's specification by clockmaker Edward John Dent, was completed before the tower itself, Denison ditched the original deadbeat escapement and remontoire, and invented the double three-legged gravity escapement. This provides the best separation between pendulum and clock mechanism. Together with an enclosed, wind-proof box sunk beneath the clockroom, the Great Clock's pendulum is well isolated from external factors like snow, ice and pigeons on the clock hands, and keeps remarkably accurate time.

<photo  date_taken="2006-11-09 10:49:49" description="Westminster Hall, the oldest existing part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/299909312/&quot;&gt;Palace of Westminster&lt;/a&gt;, was built by William II in 1097, after moving hsi royal residence from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/303819581/&quot;&gt;Tower of London&lt;/a&gt;. Most kings followed suit for 450 years, until Henry VII built &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/301020278/&quot;&gt;St. James's Palace&lt;/a&gt; in 1530. Westminster Hall is the only part of the original Palace to survive the fire of 1834 and was incorporated into Sir Charles Barry's Perpendicur Gothic design of the new palace. The Hall is marked by Hamo Thornycroft's 1899 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/301431025&quot;&gt;statue of Oliver Cromwell&lt;/a&gt;--it was here that he was sworn in as Lord Protector in 1643, and Marochetti's 1860 statue of Richard the Lionheart (pictured here)--seated on his horse, sword raised. The roof of the Hall was originally supported by pillars but, during the reign of King Richard II, it was replaced by a hammerbeam roof designed by Henry Yevele and Hugh Herland. Westminster Hall is one of the largest halls in Europe with an unsupported roof, measuring 21x73m (68x240'). Although originally designed as a banquet hall, it came to be used primarily for judicial purposes, housing three of the most important courts in the land--the Court of King's Bench, the Court of Common Pleas, and the Court of Chancery--until they moved to the Royal Courts of Justice in 1882. It was here that the impeachment trial of Charles I after the Civil War, and the treason trials of Anne Boleyna, William Wallace and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/305373294/&quot;&gt;Guy Fawkes&lt;/a&gt; were held. From the 12th to 19th centuries, coronation banquets were held here, the last belonging to King George IV (1821). Today Westminster Hall is used for lyings-in-state, usually reserved for the Sovereign and their consorts. The only non-royals to receive one in the 20th century were Frederick Sleigh Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts (1914) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/299906121/&quot;&gt;Sir Winston Churchill&lt;/a&gt; (1965). The most recent was that of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in 2002. Over the middle of the Palace lies St. Stephen's Tower, also called the Central Tower. At 91m (300') it is the shortest of the three principal towers, and is the only one with a spire. The octagonally shaped tower stands immediately above the Central Lobby. Its function was originally as a high-level air intake." id="301408650" latitude="51.499172" license="3" longitude="-0.12564" nbComments="1" rank="103" tags="uk unitedkingdom britain greatbritain londonist europe palaceofwestminster palace westminster ststephenstower statue sculpture williamtheconquerer westminsterpalace gothic gothicrevival unesco worldheritage worldheritagesite unescoworldheritage unescoworldheritagesite gradei englishheritage houseofparliament housesofparliament westminsterhall victoriangothic tower centraltower palaceyard london england richardthelionheart carlomarochetti gradeilisted" title="UK - London - Westminster: Palace of Westminster - Westminster Hall" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/119/301408650_3b1f99d8ca_b.jpg" username="wallyg" views="1574" />
<photo  date_taken="2011-06-07 12:41:19" description="Article from The Independent Friday, 3 June 2011 Brian Haw's anti-war protest camp has dominated Parliament Square for 10 years, cut off from curious pedestrians by the busy lanes of traffic that surround it. Now Westminster City Council wants to change that by installing a pedestrian crossing. Although they claim their intention is merely to make it easier for Londoners and tourists to access the square, its creation is also likely to result in the eviction of Mr Haw and the protesters gathered around him. In March, a High Court ruling obtained by the Mayor of London Boris Johnson forced Mr Haw to move his camp from the grass on the square to the pavement. Now the council, which is responsible for the pavement, is seeking to repeal his right to sleep there too – by establishing that he and his fellow protesters are &amp;quot;proving an obstruction to the footway&amp;quot; and acting as a &amp;quot;hindrance&amp;quot; to pedestrians. Mr Haw, a carpenter from Worcestershire, set up his camp in 2001 and remained there until September last year, when he was flown to Germany to be treated for lung cancer. Martin Lowe, Westminster City Council's city commissioner of transportation, said they had previously been unable to win the case against Mr Haw because there had never been enough people on the square to validate any obstruction. He said he hoped the crossing would encourage more people to walk on the square's surrounding footpaths, where the protesters' tents are situated. But he denied that the primary motive behind the plan was to convince the court to remove the activists. &amp;quot;The main reason for wanting a crossing is simply to showcase the centre of the square, which is lovely. &amp;quot;People want to visit the buildings around Parliament Square, visit the Winston Churchill and Nelson Mandela statues, and simply chill out – it is a nice place to be. We ought to be giving people a good safe opportunity to get to and from the central space.&amp;quot; Councillor Colin Barrow, the leader of Westminster Council, was more direct. He said: &amp;quot;For too long this camp has dominated the square which should be available for all. &amp;quot;We of course support the right to protest and will continue to do so, but the camping out for years on end has turned the area into an eyesore. I think they have made their point and now is time to reclaim the square for all Londoners and visitors once and for all. &amp;quot;By installing this crossing we believe we are helping to achieve that and providing a safe way to access the square rather than a sprint across several lanes of traffic.&amp;quot; Babs Tucker, who has spent the last five years living in one of the tents on Parliament Square, said she thought there was probably an &amp;quot;ulterior motive&amp;quot; behind the plans, which she described as &amp;quot;childish&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;The camp has been here 10 years and now they want to crack on about a pedestrian crossing,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;It is so ridiculous, but no matter what they try and do, we are going to stand our ground.&amp;quot;" id="5809753404" latitude="51.500581" license="5" longitude="-0.126841" nbComments="1" rank="104" tags="england london patrickinlondon peacecamp peaceprotest protestcamp antiwar parliamentsquare westminster" title="Peace protest camp in London" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/3239/5809753404_32096b7c28_b.jpg" username="wallygrom" views="140" />

The arch, which leads into the Commons Chamber, was damaged in an air raid on 10 May 1941 when the Chamber was completely destroyed by fire that caused the ceiling to collapse. It was rebuilt using the original bomb-scarred stone at the suggestion of Winston Churchill as a reminder to future generations of the fortitude of those who stood firm through those times.
