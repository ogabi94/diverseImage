<photo  date_taken="2009-11-29 12:59:58" description="Golden Temple, Amritsar - Punjab, India From Wiki - Golden Temple[1] (Punjabi: ਹਰਿਮੰਦਰ ਸਾਹਿਬ) or Harmandir Sahib[3] (Punjabi: ਦਰਬਾਰ ਸਾਹਿਬ), informally referred to as The Golden Temple or Temple of God,[1] is culturally the most significant place of worship of the Sikhs and one of the oldest Sikh gurdwaras. It is located in the city of Amritsar, which was established by Guru Ram Das Ji, the fourth guru of the Sikhs, and is, also due to the shrine, known as Guru Di Nagri meaning city of the Guru. The temple is surrounded by a large Sarovar (manmade lake), known as the AmritSar (Lake of Holy Water or Immortal Nectar). There are entrances to the temple on all four sides, signifying the importance of acceptance and openness; ostensibly, this concept is reminiscent of the tent of Abraham in the Old Testament—his tent was open on all four sides in order to be able to welcome travelers from all directions." id="4143898569" latitude="0" license="3" longitude="0" nbComments="6" rank="4" tags="nikond80 punjab amritsar goldentemple harmandirsahib" title="Golden Temple" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/2713/4143898569_a3bd2617bd_b.jpg" username="Abhijit Tembhekar" views="561" />

<photo  date_taken="2006-09-19 22:58:48" description="A Panorma of the Golden Temple in the morning as the sun rises. The past week or so it has gotten cold all of a sudden here in Espanola. I think winter is coming. As I was looking through some of my pictures I found the above picture of the Golden Temple from my last trip to India in Jan 2005. It reminds me of winter. Every time I go to Amritsar I always take pictures of Harimandir Sahib. On this trip I wanted to watch the sun rise behind the Golden Temple and take some pictures. So I went up on the roof of one part of the wall that surrounds the Hari Mandir Sahib. It was really cold that morning and I was barefoot with only a small jacket. The cold cement floor didn’t help either. I was starting to really shiver with cold so I paced up and down the wall, waiting for the sun to start to show light in the horizon. Time seemed to slow as I waited. Then, as I walked up and down the roof trying to keep warm I discovered my source of “survival”. I found a spot which was kind of a vent where warm steam/air flowed out. It turns out that this was a sweet smelling exhaust vent for the Parshad kitchen below! Not only did it warm my feet…but the sweet aroma of parshad made me feel good. So there I sat, huddled over the vent, watching the sun start to light the morning sky over Harimandir Sahib, with sweet aromas of parshad in the air keeping a smile on my face. So the next time you are up on the roof of the wall above the parshad kitchen, waiting for the sun to rise, go look for the “parshad heater!” Hahaha….. The above picture is from that morning out in the cold, warming my ice cube toes with steam/air from the Guru’s Kitchen." id="248022130" latitude="31.628025" license="1" longitude="74.865303" nbComments="11" rank="13" tags="panorma widescreen golden temple dual screen amritsar sikh sikhism harimandir sahib" title="Golden Temple Panorama" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/86/248022130_23ea9d4b0a_b.jpg" username="Gurumustuk Singh" views="3096" />

<photo  date_taken="2005-01-12 18:28:10" description="The past week or so it has gotten cold all of a sudden here in Espanola. I think winter is coming. As I was looking through some of my pictures I found the above picture of the Golden Temple from my last trip to India in Jan 2005. It reminds me of winter. Every time I go to Amritsar I always take pictures of Harimandir Sahib. On this trip I wanted to watch the sun rise behind the Golden Temple and take some pictures. So I went up on the roof of one part of the wall that surrounds the Hari Mandir Sahib. It was really cold that morning and I was barefoot with only a small jacket. The cold cement floor didn’t help either. I was starting to really shiver with cold so I paced up and down the wall, waiting for the sun to start to show light in the horizon. Time seemed to slow as I waited. Then, as I walked up and down the roof trying to keep warm I discovered my source of “survival”. I found a spot which was kind of a vent where warm steam/air flowed out. It turns out that this was a sweet smelling exhaust vent for the Parshad kitchen below! Not only did it warm my feet…but the sweet aroma of parshad made me feel good. So there I sat, huddled over the vent, watching the sun start to light the morning sky over Harimandir Sahib, with sweet aromas of parshad in the air keeping a smile on my face. So the next time you are up on the roof of the wall above the parshad kitchen, waiting for the sun to rise, go look for the “parshad heater!” Hahaha….. The above picture is from that morning out in the cold, warming my ice cube toes with steam/air from the Guru’s Kitchen." id="247993963" latitude="31.628025" license="1" longitude="74.865303" nbComments="2" rank="59" tags="sunrise golden temple hari mandir sahib amritsar india sikh sikhism gurdwara" title="Golden Temple Sunrise" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/91/247993963_dc510ecd2a_b.jpg" username="Gurumustuk Singh" views="2569" />
