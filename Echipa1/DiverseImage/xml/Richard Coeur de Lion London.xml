<photo  date_taken="2009-08-14 09:35:46" description="Friday 14 August: This morning is our first view of the statue. Having had such an intimate relationship with it over the last few weeks it is fantastic to see it as the sculptor intended, from the ground and at a distance. Compared with how it looked before conservation the difference is astounding. All the details, such as the horse’s veins and the King’s chain mail, are clearly visible now the black wax is gone, and the reflection of light from the wax surfaces really brings the sculpture to life.

Made in 1860 by Baron Carlo Marochetti. He was known as Richard the Lionheart and Coeur de Lion (as is inscribed on the plinth) even before he became king, because of his reputation as a military leader and warrior. It is Grade II listed.

While the overall effect of Richard seated on this horse with sword brandished aloft is quite heroic, it was said in the Art Journal at the time it was erected that it was 'a fine statue, but one which is so entirely unfinished that we should never regard it otherwise than as a sketch'. This may indeed have been illusion to the fact that an earlier, and more finished, &lt;a href=&quot;http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/speel/pico/fc1131.jpg&quot;&gt; version of this statue&lt;/a&gt; by Carlo Marochetti (1805-1867) stood outside the entrance to the Great Exhibition of 1851 in Hyde Park.

<photo  date_taken="2009-07-30 13:35:10" description="We think we have identified the 1908-09 area of frost damage - the junction between the raised foreleg and the body has a number of repairs which are a very different style to the rest, which indicates they are not connected to the original casting and building.

<photo  date_taken="2009-07-30 13:39:57" description="When the statue was cast it was made in a large number of small pieces which then had to be joined together, around the steel armature. Roman joints would have been used widely. The two elements to be joined would have been overlapped and holes drilled through the two layers. Cone-shaped bronze plugs would have been inserted into the holes and hammered in. The two sheets would have drawn tighter and tighter together and once they could be hammered in no further, any excess plugs would have been cut off and the joint smoothed over. You can see the line of plug ends and the joint here on the horse’s flank.
