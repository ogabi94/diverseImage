<photo  date_taken="2010-03-31 16:07:35" description="The American Period (1821 - Present): The Civil War Years Florida was granted statehood in 1845 as the 27th state. At the beginning of the Civil War Florida was the third state to vote for Secession which she did on January 10, 1861. Confederate troops immediately took Fort Marion (Castillo de San Marcos) from the lone Union sergeant caretaker who asked for a receipt and travel money out of town. Believing the war would soon be over and would never come this far south, the Confederates removed most of the cannon from Fort Marion and sent them to more strategic forts. In March 1862, the Union Navy arrived off the coast of St. Augustine. With no guns for defense, Fort Marion was abandoned, and the Union forces took over. The St. Augustine area remained in Federal hands for the remainder of the war. With the St. Johns River heavily patrolled, Confederate blockade runners attempted to use the Matanzas Inlet during the War, but the Union army stationed a barge in the river near the fort ruins, and attempts to pass were unsuccessful. This activity had little effect on the old tower, however, and soon the area was abandoned once more, and with the passage of time, the tower began to deteriorate even further. It was a quaint ruin overgrown with vegetation in 1872 when artist Harry Fenn sketched the fort for the book Picturesque America. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nps.gov/foma/historyculture/am-period.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.nps.gov/foma/historyculture/am-period.htm&lt;/a&gt;" id="4488272292" latitude="0" license="4" longitude="0" nbComments="0" rank="2" tags="fl florida fort fortmatanzas matanzas nps nationalpark nationalparkservice staugustineaugustine springbreak staugustine" title="Fort Matanzas" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/4061/4488272292_a91b9214ee_b.jpg" username="cliff1066™" views="183" />
<photo  date_taken="2010-03-31 16:07:45" description="The British Period (1763-1784): The British at Fort Matanzas The English staffed Fort Matanzas with one sergeant, six or eight privates of infantry and one private from the Royal Artillery. As the political climate changed as the American colonies moved towards revolution, more cannon were added with two 18-pounders placed at the fort in 1763. Life for the English soldiers at Fort Matanzas probably differed little from their Spanish counterparts. Days were spent in drill, repair to the fort and equipment, and foraging for food as the officer attempted to keep his men occupied with useful tasks. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nps.gov/foma/historyculture/the-british-period.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.nps.gov/foma/historyculture/the-british-period.htm&lt;/a&gt;" id="4487625897" latitude="0" license="4" longitude="0" nbComments="0" rank="3" tags="fl florida fort fortmatanzas matanzas nps nationalpark nationalparkservice staugustineaugustine springbreak staugustine" title="Fort Matanzas" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/4027/4487625897_3a35275d31_b.jpg" username="cliff1066™" views="164" />
<photo  date_taken="2010-03-31 16:07:35" description="The Second Spanish Period (1784-1821) In return for Spain’s help during the American Revolution, Florida was transferred back to Spain by the Treaties of Versailles, part of the Peace of Paris, in 1783. Just like when the whole Spanish population moved to Cuba when the British took control, this time most of the British departed for British colonies in the Caribbean in spite of Governor Zespedes’ promise of equal treatment. The Menorcans, however, were very glad to have a Spanish, Catholic government return to power. Governor Zespedes knew Florida needed more people, regardless of nationality, in order to survive. He offered large land grants, a ten year tax free occupancy, and a cash bonus to any family who would come to start a farm. He even offered to pay each pioneer 1.5 cents a day for feed supplies. Despite these generous offers, it was necessary by 1786 to drop the restrictions on non-Catholic settlers. Equally significant, the Spanish Government agreed to allow the migration of slave holders into Florida for the first time. One of the slave holders who took advantage of the land grant offer was Zephaniah Kingsley, who along with his wife Anna Madgigine Jai, herself an ex-slave from Africa, owned and managed Kingsley Plantation on Fort George Island. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nps.gov/foma/historyculture/second-spanish.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.nps.gov/foma/historyculture/second-spanish.htm&lt;/a&gt;" id="4488271832" latitude="0" license="4" longitude="0" nbComments="0" rank="4" tags="fl florida fort fortmatanzas matanzas nps nationalpark nationalparkservice staugustineaugustine springbreak staugustine" title="Fort Matanzas" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/2748/4488271832_cd16e5e1ab_b.jpg" username="cliff1066™" views="109" />

In 1885, railroad tycoon and former Standard Oil partner Henry Morrison Flagler moved Florida's resorts to a new level with his 540-room grand Ponce de León Hotel in St. Augustine. The first of three Flagler hotels in the city, the Ponce de León (now the main building of Flagler College) combined exotic Spanish Renaissance and Moorish architectural features with innovative poured concrete construction. Whisked south in their private cars on Flagler's Florida East Coast Railroad, notables such as the Vanderbilts, Rockefellers, and Morgans made St. Augustine their winter home, expanding the old colonial city westward on King Street and north on San Marco. Many of the buildings downtown reflect this golden era. The Villa Zorayda, an exotic Moorish Revival style residence with courtyards and towers built in 1883 on King Street, is from this glittering time-period as is the Flagler Memorial Presbyterian Church (1880), and Castle Warden (1879), now Ripley's Believe it or Not Museum. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nps.gov/foma/historyculture/am-period.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.nps.gov/foma/historyculture/am-period.htm&lt;/a&gt;" id="4487626929" latitude="0" license="4" longitude="0" nbComments="0" rank="23" tags="fl florida fort fortmatanzas matanzas nps nationalpark nationalparkservice staugustineaugustine springbreak staugustine" title="Fort Matanzas" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/4054/4487626929_8947a6fcbc_b.jpg" username="cliff1066™" views="190" />
<photo  date_taken="2010-03-31 16:07:37" description="The American Period (1821 - Present): The Territorial Period (1821-1845) Only three Spanish soldiers were in residence at Fort Matanzas when the United States took possession in 1821. The interior was in ruins, and the gun platform's east wall and its foundation had cracked. The U.S. Army sent an inspector who reported that the tower was obsolete and had only historical value. Although owned by the War Department, Fort Matanzas was never occupied by the United States army. These early years as part of the United States were years of conflict for Florida. For years Indian groups who had been pushed off their land in Georgia and Alabama by white settlers had found refuge in Spanish Florida. These Indians, primarily Creeks, along with escaped African slaves, became known as Cimmarones or wild ones, the probable origin of the word Seminole. However, once Florida became a territory of the United States, these Indians were no longer safe. The US Army raided their settlements, and the Seminoles and whites engaged in a series of long, expensive wars ending with 4000 -5000 Seminoles being shipped to reservations in Oklahoma, and the tattered remnants of a proud people finally finding some refuge in the wilds of the Everglades. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nps.gov/foma/historyculture/am-period.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.nps.gov/foma/historyculture/am-period.htm&lt;/a&gt;" id="4488273466" latitude="0" license="4" longitude="0" nbComments="0" rank="24" tags="fl florida fort fortmatanzas matanzas nps nationalpark nationalparkservice staugustineaugustine springbreak staugustine" title="Fort Matanzas" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/2699/4488273466_055a144ce3_b.jpg" username="cliff1066™" views="74" />

Charles Towne (Charleston) in the Carolina Colony was established by the English in 1670. The English colony of Georgia was founded in 1733 by General James Oglethorpe.

<photo  date_taken="2010-03-31 16:37:52" description="The Early People Archaeological research tells us that at least 12,000 years ago, long before Europeans came to Florida, wandering hunter-gatherer people arrived. They lived a simple life, following the great herds of mammoths and other mega-fauna and gathering the wild grains, nuts, and berries they found in their seasonal wanderings. No one knows what these people called themselves, but to archaeologists, they are known as Paleo-Indians, the oldest Indians. As the large prey died out, these people began to exploit the vast water resources. Fish, shellfish, turtles, and alligators became a major part of their diet. Hollowed out log canoes enabled them to travel the many rivers. About 4000 years ago they invented a soft, porous pottery with an orange color, This pottery was tempered with Spanish moss that burned away as the pottery was fired. Because of the orange color of this pottery, these people are known as a the &amp;quot;Orange Period&amp;quot; culture. About 2500 years ago, as the various groups of archaic people began to become more settled in one place, each group began to develop a distinct regional culture while maintaining several customs in common. The people who lived along the St. Johns River in east-central and northeast Florida were known as the Timucuan. Today, only the shell middens (trash heaps) of these early people remain. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nps.gov/foma/historyculture/earlypeoples.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.nps.gov/foma/historyculture/earlypeoples.htm&lt;/a&gt;" id="4488294126" latitude="0" license="4" longitude="0" nbComments="0" rank="30" tags="fl florida nps nationalpark nationalparkservice staugustine springbreak fortmatanzas fort matanzas" title="Fort Matanzas" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/4039/4488294126_c818610970_b.jpg" username="cliff1066™" views="101" />

<photo  date_taken="2010-03-31 16:26:30" description="Hunting &amp;amp; Food: Great Horned Owls hunt by perching on snags and poles and watching for prey, or by gliding slowly above the ground. From high perches they dive down to the ground with wings folded, before snatching prey. Prey are usually killed instantly when grasped by its large talons. They also hunt by walking on the ground to capture small prey or wading into water to snatch frogs and fish. They have been known to walk into chicken coops to take domestic fowl. Rodents and small rabbits can be swallowed whole while larger prey are carried off and ripped apart at feeding perches or at the nest. Birds are often plucked first, and legs and wing tips discarded. An extremely wide range of prey species (over 250 identified) are captured, but rabbits and hares are its preferred prey. Mammalian prey includes all coexisting rodents, squirrels, mink, skunks, raccoons, armadillos, porcupines, shrews, moles, muskrats, and bats. They may sometimes take small domestic dogs and cats. Bird prey includes all other Owls (except Snowy Owl), grouse, woodpeckers, crows, turkeys, pigeons, Red-tailed Hawks, bitterns, Great Blue Heron, ducks, swans, gulls, etc. Reptiles include snakes, turtles, lizards, and young alligators. Amphibians include frogs, toads, and salamanders. Other foods include fish, large insects, scorpions, centipedes, crayfish, worms, spiders, and road killed animals. A Great Horned Owl is powerful enough to take prey 2 to 3 times heavier than itself. Pellets are very large, about 7.6 to 10.2 cm (3- 4&amp;quot;) long and 3.8 cm (1.5&amp;quot;) thick. Pellets are dark greyish-black and compact. Skulls as wide as 3 cm (1.2&amp;quot;) are regurgitated whole. Pellets are regurgitated 6 to 10 hours after eating. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.owlpages.com/owls.php?genus=Bubo&amp;amp;species=virginianus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.owlpages.com/owls.php?genus=Bubo&amp;amp;species=virginianus&lt;/a&gt;" id="4488508924" latitude="0" license="4" longitude="0" nbComments="0" rank="51" tags="fl florida fort fortmatanzas greathorned greathornedowl hornedowl matanzas nps nationalpark nationalparkservice owl staugustine springbreak bubovirginianus bubo virginianus" title="Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus) - Baby 2½ Week Old" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/2700/4488508924_9d0821471a_b.jpg" username="cliff1066™" views="256" />

<photo  date_taken="2010-03-31 16:28:38" description="Description: Great Horned Owls can vary in color from a reddish brown to a grey or black and white. The underside is a light grey with dark bars and a white band of feathers on the upper breast. They have large, staring yellow-orange eyes, bordered in most races by an orange-buff facial disc. The name is derived from tufts of feathers that appear to be &amp;quot;horns&amp;quot; which are sometimes referred to as &amp;quot;ear tufts&amp;quot; but have nothing to do with hearing at all. The large feet are feathered to the ends of the toes, and the immature birds resemble the adults.

<photo  date_taken="2010-03-31 16:26:18" description="Breeding: Nesting season is in January or February when the males and females hoot to each other. When close they bow to each other, with drooped wings. Mutual bill rubbing and preening also occurs. They do not build a nest of their own but utilise the nests of other birds such as the hawk, crow and heron. They may also use squirrel nests, hollows in trees, rocky caves, clumps of witches broom, abandoned buildings, or on artificial platforms. They are extremely aggressive when defending the nest and will continue to attack until the intruder is killed or driven off. Normally, two to four eggs are laid and incubated by the female only for 26-35 days. Young start roaming from the nest onto nearby branches at 6 to 7 weeks, when they are called &amp;quot;branchers&amp;quot;, but cannot fly well until 9 to 10 weeks old. They are fed for another few weeks as they are slowly weaned. Families remain loosely associated during summer before young disperse in the autumn. Adults tend to remain near their breeding areas year-round while juveniles disperse widely, over 250 km (150 miles) in the autumn. Territories are maintained by the same pair for as many as 8 consecutive years, however, these Owls are solitary in nature, only staying with their mate during the nesting season. Average home ranges in various studies have been shown to be approximately 2.5 square kms (1 square mile). &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.owlpages.com/owls.php?genus=Bubo&amp;amp;species=virginianus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.owlpages.com/owls.php?genus=Bubo&amp;amp;species=virginianus&lt;/a&gt;" id="4488508434" latitude="0" license="4" longitude="0" nbComments="0" rank="77" tags="fl florida fort fortmatanzas greathorned greathornedowl hornedowl matanzas nps nationalpark nationalparkservice owl staugustine springbreak bubovirginianus bubo virginianus" title="Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus) - Baby 2½ Week Old" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/2783/4488508434_72656d6dd6_b.jpg" username="cliff1066™" views="127" />
