It is one of the busiest railway stations in India[citation needed], and serves Central Railway trains terminating in Mumbai as well as the Mumbai suburban railway. The station was designed by Frederick William Stevens, a consulting architect in 1887-1888, for the princely sum of 16.14 lakh rupees. Stevens earned the commission to construct the station after a masterpiece water colour sketch by draughts man Axel Herman. After earning the commission, Stevens went on a ten-month trip to Europe to make a detailed study of the stations there. The final design bears some resemblance to St. Pancras station in London[citation needed]. It took ten years to complete and was named &amp;quot;Victoria Terminus&amp;quot; in honor of the reigning Queen Victoria. In 1996, the station was renamed by the state government after Chhatrapati Shivaji, a famed 17th century Maratha king. On July 2, 2004 the station was nominated a World Heritage Site by the World Heritage Committee of UNESCO. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Terminus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Terminus&lt;/a&gt;" id="381909286" latitude="18.939326" license="3" longitude="72.834956" nbComments="3" rank="1" tags="thechhatrapatishivajiterminus vt victoriaterminus mumbai india chhatrapatishivajiterminus thevictoriaterminus wwwhumayooncom humayun humayoon humayunn humayunnnapeerzaada humayunnapeerzaada peerzada peerzaada maharashtra model actor photographer kutch madai kudachi kudchi deolali worldheritagesite worldheritagecommittee unesco cst mumbaisuburbanrailway छत्रपतीशिवाजीटर्मिनस victoriangothic victorianitalianategothicrevivalarchitecture bombayschoolofart 19thcenturyrailwayarchitecturalmarvels 19thcentury frederickwilliamstevens architect 18871888 queenvictoria draughtsmanaxelherman draughtsman axelherman europe chhatrapatishivaji 17thcenturymarathaking 17thcentury marathaking maratha छत्रपतीशिवाजीटरमीनस" title="Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, Mumbai, Maharashtra - India" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/174/381909286_a9c122685c_b.jpg" username="Humayunn N A Peerzaada" views="2449" />

It took ten years to complete and was named &amp;quot;Victoria Terminus&amp;quot; in honour of the Queen and Empress Victoria; it was opened on the date of her Golden Jubilee in 1887.

In 2008, the station was featured prominently in the Academy Award winning film Slumdog Millionaire. Terrorist attacks in 2008 On 26 November 2008, two terrorists entered the passenger hall of the CST, opened fire and threw grenades at people. The terrorists were armed with AK-47 rifles. More than 50 people were killed in the attack. (For this reason, photography is not permitted inside the building.) The station building was designed in the Victorian Gothic style of architecture. The building exhibits a fusion of influences from Victorian Italianate Gothic Revival architecture and traditional Indian architecture. Internally, the wood carving, tiles, ornamental iron and brass railings, grills for the ticket offices, the balustrades for the grand staircases and other ornaments were the work of students at the Bombay School of Art. The station stands as an example of 19th century railway architectural marvels for its advanced structural and technical solutions. The network of suburban trains (locally known as locals, short for local trains) radiating out from this station is instrumental in keeping Mumbai running. The station serves long-distance trains as well as two of the suburban lines-the Central Line and the Harbour line. It is the westernmost terminus of Central Railway.

<photo  date_taken="2006-03-25 16:45:44" description="Victoria Terminus from subway passage. About VT: Modeled on the lines of the St Pancras Station in London, Victoria Terminus is undoubtedly the Raj's piece de resistance, Complete with carved stone friezes, stained glass windows and flying buttresses. It is Gothic architecture at its best, an awesome edifice that most citizens view with deep pride. At the top of the central dome stands the triumphant figure of Progress. The station was christened to commemorate Victoria Jubilee Day in 1887 when India's first steam engine puffed out to neighboring Thane, about 45 kms away. Today it has been rechristened Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus after the Maratha warrior. And the old steam engines have been replaced by electric ones. But to the 2.5 million commuters who push past its massive portals everyday, this is still VT, the pulse of a throbbing city." id="131071628" latitude="0" license="1" longitude="0" nbComments="8" rank="26" tags="mumbai bombay india victoria train station railways victoriaterminus chhatrapatishivajiterminus chhatrapatishivaji" title="The Sweeper" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/48/131071628_0f763fa684_b.jpg" username="Rigmarole" views="716" />
