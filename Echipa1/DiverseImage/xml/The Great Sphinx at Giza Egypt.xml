<photo  date_taken="2012-07-25 07:21:45" description="Pyramids at Giza, Egypt are featured in this image photographed by an Expedition 32 crew member on the International Space Station. The Great Pyramids at Giza (center) are the last of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and are perhaps the most famous of the ancient monuments in the Nile River Delta region of Egypt. They are also a favorite subject of photography from orbit -- particularly when high resolution imagery can be obtained. The southeast-facing sides of the pyramids of the pharaohs Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure are all brightly illuminated by the sun, while the northwest facing sides are in shadow. This shadowing also highlights smaller unfinished pyramids to the south of Menkaure's pyramid, as well as fields of rectangular flat roofed mastabas (tombs) to the east and west of Khufu's pyramid. While not as grand as the pyramids, mastabas were the burial places of prominent persons during the periods of the ancient pharaohs. To the southeast of Khufu's pyramid, the head and rear haunches of the Sphinx are also visible (albeit not clearly). It is a short distance between the glories of ancient Egypt and the modern Cairo metropolitan area to the north and east. The green vegetation of a hotel golf course (center left), and the numerous building and streets of El Giza, provide stark contrast to the bare rock and soil of the adjacent desert. Roadways visible in the desert (right) connect the urban regions to the east with further development to the north.

<photo  date_taken="2006-01-22 20:13:53" description="The view of the sphinx and the pyramid of giza, taken during a daytrip to cairo. This was my favourite view of the sphinx as the pyramid makes the perfect backdrop. The Great Sphinx is one of the world’s largest and oldest statues and is believed to represent the likeness of King Khafra who was buried in the pyramid which sits directly behind the Sphinx. This would mean that the sphinx was built between 2520 and 2494BC Many egyptologists believe the sphinx was carved to disguise a large immovable rock which was obstructing the view of the pyramid. The pyramid you can see in the background of the picture is the Pyramid of Khufu ( Also known as &amp;quot;The Great Pyramid&amp;quot; or the &amp;quot;Pyramid of Cheops&amp;quot; . This is the oldest and largest of the Pyramids at Giza. The Pyramid of Khufu was constructed in 2570 BC and is 455.2ft tall." id="89837579" latitude="29.990623" license="2" longitude="31.072082" nbComments="12" rank="5" tags="cairo egypt pyramids sphinx pyramid giza greatsphinx pyramidofcheops greatpyramid khufu" title="The Sphinx and the Great Pyramid of Giza" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/32/89837579_ca50dc1fce_b.jpg" username="Sam and Ian" views="41251" />
<photo  date_taken="2008-11-22 12:41:31" description="This ~4500 year old boat was found practically intact by a group of Egyptian archeologists lead by Kamal el Mallakh. Except for one oar, the boat was in remarkable condition. The boat was almost certainly built for Cheops or Khufu, the second Pharoah of the Fourth Dynasty of the King of Egypt. The Khufu ship was sealed into a pit in the Giza pyramid complex at the foot of the Great Pyramid of Giza around 2,500 BC. Information about the boat can be found in many places, but I liked this folksy one &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/solar.htm&quot;&gt;the best&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;The following story is from the Mena House Oberoi book written by Nina Nelson and relates the story told to her by Kamal el Mallakh who discovered Cheops' Solar Boat. Kaamal el Mallakh was born in Assuit, Egypt on October 26, 1918. He was a dedicated scholar of Egyptology and culture and remained a bachelor until his death in October of 1987. The most fascinating visit I have had at the pyramids was when Kamal el Mallakh took me to see the solar boat he discovered in 1954. What Cheops mighty pyramid was to do for the pharaoh's body, the boat was to do for his Ka, or soul. The boat is most beautiful. Stretching almost 150 feet in length, some of the boat's timbers are made from whole cedars of Lebanon. The prow sweeps upward, with a papyrus end, while the bow curves inward and is tipped with a magnificently carved papyrus blossom. There are hand carved oars and ropes that might have been made today. The boat's state of preservation is remarkable. It must be the most fantastic find since Tutankhamen's tomb. The story of the solar boat's discovery is scarcely less fascinating than the find itself. In April 1950, close by the side of the Great Pyramid that faces the Sphinx, a road was being made for the convenience of tourists. Kamal kept an eye on the digging. His excitement was great when his men dug down to limestone powder, not the kind that capped Chephren's pyramid close by, but of the type found in the Makattam Hills on the other side of Cairo. As the men continued to dig they came upon pink cement which in turn revealed great slabs. The men uncovered either a large flat base or a great roof. Kamal thought the latter. But it was difficult to be sure and often, great finds seem on the brink and end in disappointment. Perhaps the slabs formed part of the foundation of Cheop's Pyramid. Kamal had been working on the Giza site for fourteen years and it was the first time he felt Cheops' Solar Boat might be uncovered. But boat pits by the lesser pyramids had yielded nothing, and even if it was a boat it might have been robbed in antiquity. Kamal felt he would be satisfied if only some vestiges of a Solar Boat were found. All boat pits could not be empty. But of one thing he was certain. He could not rest until he knew the answer. Together with a team of men he cleared an area large enough to see that the great slabs might indeed form a roof. He then began to scrape down between two blocks that seemed less sturdy than the others. He made a deep chink between the two. On May 26th, 1954, he began digging in earnest. He kept on until the hole was large enough for him to be lowered into it head first. He was armed with cutting and probing instruments and continued scraping. He paused for a time and glanced up along his body to the sky above and could see a black shadow lying along the apex of Cheops' Pyramid. Yet he could see no clouds. The sky was the color of lapis lazuli. He felt it was a momentous occasion, and for this reason his heart beat against his rib cage. He breathed deeply, closed his eyes to accustom them to the gloom of his digging and then opened them slowly. With a steady hand he began to cut again. He worked quickly as the casing gave way and crumbled. He made the hole deep enough to twist his body in a different position downward and worked only a few inches away from his head. He kept on cutting and cutting. Time meant nothing. He was not conscious of being tired, or of lying in a perpendicular position. He probed. He cut. Suddenly and miraculously his hands were through into nothingness. He lay as if in a trance. He closed his eyes. An almost imperceptible smell crept into his nostrils. He could not define what it was. It was almost sweet. It could not be incense. Or was it? Was it perhaps the very smell of history? Then he knew. It was cedar wood! His eyes were still unopened. He drew a deep breath and determined that it was indeed cedar wood. He felt a sense of fulfillment such as he had never known before. Happiness tingled through him. His eyes were still closed. He whispered a prayer of thanks to God. His questioning mind began to function again. If indeed he smelt cedar wood from a Solar Boat below it did not mean that the white ant had not been busy. Perhaps the precious wood had been eaten through by hordes of white ants. He shouted up to his men to hand him his mirror. It was a small, shaving variety. He reached up with one arm as far as he could and the mirror was lowered to him. He brought his hand down gently and gradually twisted into a new position so that he could plunge his arm down as far as possible in the aperture. The smell of cedar wood was now unmistakable but he could see nothing. He pushed his head against the jagged stonework and tried to turn his body so that the sunlight would slant down his back into the opening. He rocked his hand to and fro. Suddenly he caught sunrays on the mirror. He manipulated it slowly so that the light reflected downward. He saw something - something silver and bright. What could it be? He carefully moved the mirror once more and then he suddenly saw the perfect reflection of the plate tip of an oar. His hand began to shake. He felt a great strength surge through his whole body. &amp;quot;It is the boat!&amp;quot; he shouted. &amp;quot;It is the boat!&amp;quot; Willing, trembling hands pulled him upward. His men were beside themselves with joy. &amp;quot;Congratulations, congratulations,&amp;quot; they cried, tears streaming down their smiling faces. Kamal held his hand to his forehead. It was shaking and his forehead felt hot and sticky. He looked at his palm. It was covered in blood. &amp;quot;Your head! Your poor head,&amp;quot; said one man holding a handkerchief solicitously. Kamal had shoved his head so far into the stone he had not only cut his forehead but pushed into the bone! As Kamal el Mallakh finished telling me the tale of how he had found Cheops' Solar Boat in its air-tight pit, I glanced at his forehead. An indented white mark showed up against his tanned skin. &amp;quot;I suppose one might call it an honorable scar,&amp;quot; he smiled. &amp;quot;Let us go back to Mena House and have tea!&amp;quot;" id="3313538868" latitude="0" license="2" longitude="0" nbComments="3" rank="6" tags="egypt giza cheops cheopsboat khufu kaamal kaamalelmallakh egyptology greatpyramid" title="Cheops' Boat, Giza, Egypt" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/3344/3313538868_1517d5ab8a_b.jpg" username="drona" views="2168" />

<photo  date_taken="2001-02-19 00:00:15" description="The Luxor Hotel, designed by renowned hotel architect Veldon Simpson, instantly became one of the most recognizable hotels on the Las Vegas Strip when it opened on OCtober 15, 1993. With its Ancient Egyptian motif, it contains 4,407 rooms lining the interior walls of a hollow 350-foot-high (137m), 30-story pyramid of black glass (in comparison, the Great Pyramid of Giza tops out at 450 ft/137 m) and within two twin ziggurat towers. The hotel is marked by a large obelisk with the name of the property in lighted letters, while the porte-cochere travels underneath a massive recreation of the Great Sphinx of Giza. The tip of the pyramid contains a fixed-position spotlight that points directly upward – it is the brightest beam in the world, and is visible from anywhere in the Las Vegas valley at night, and can be seen at flight level from above Los Angeles, California, over 275 miles (440 km) away. In the spring, the bright light attracts huge numbers of moths into the light beam, creating a phenomenon that has been likened to snow. The beam is currently powered by 39 Xenon lamps operating at 7 kilowatts each at an hourly operating cost of $53 (lamps, repairs, and electricity costs). The beam's output is rated at 41.5 gigacandela. Named after the city of Luxor (ancient Thebes) in Egypt, the site of the Valley of the Kings, Karnak and Luxor Temples, and scores of other pharaonic monuments – but no pyramids, the hotel is commonly viewed as one of the finest examples of 1990s Postmodern architecture, and appeared on the cover of renowned architecture scholar James Steele's book &amp;quot;Architecture Today&amp;quot;." id="149540492" latitude="36.095805" license="3" longitude="-115.174586" nbComments="3" rank="19" tags="lasvegas nevada luxor casino vegas vegasstrip lasvegasstrip hotel pyramid sphinx strip greatsphinxofgiza giza postmodern clarkcounty" title="Las Vegas: Luxor" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/46/149540492_85a2ad8f2d_b.jpg" username="wallyg" views="11176" />

<photo  date_taken="2007-04-11 11:22:09" description="It is believed the pyramid was built as a tomb for Fourth dynasty Egyptian pharaoh Khufu and constructed over a 14 to 20 year period concluding around 2551 BC. Khufu's vizier, Hemon, or Hemiunu, is believed by some to be the architect of the Great Pyramid. It is thought that, at construction, the Great Pyramid was originally 280 Egyptian cubits tall, 146.478 metres (480.57 ft) but with erosion and absence of its pyramidion, its current height is 138.75 metres (455.22 ft). Each base side was 440 royal cubits, 230.37 metres (755.81 ft) in length. A royal cubit measures 0.524 meters. The total mass of the pyramid is estimated at 5.9 million tonnes. The volume, including an internal hillock, is believed to be roughly 2,500,000 cubic meters. Based on these estimates, building this in 20 years would involve installing approximately 800 tonnes of stone every day. The first precision measurements of the pyramid were done by Egyptologist Sir Flinders Petrie in 1880–82 and published as Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh. Almost all reports are based on his measurements. Many of the casing stones and interior chamber blocks of the Great Pyramid were fit together with extremely high precision. Based on measurements taken on the north eastern casing stones, the mean opening of the joints are only 0.5 millimeters wide (1/50th of an inch)" id="1541342016" latitude="29.974992" license="5" longitude="31.137828" nbComments="3" rank="34" tags="islam arab africa history holiday explore 2007 zongo69 khufuingreekknownasχέοψ cheops pronouncedˈhɛɒpsaccordingtomanetho σουφισ suphisancientegypts25892566khufusecondpharaohofthefourthdynasty davehighbury pyramids egyptianpyramids egypt khufu oldkingdom pharaoh giza sphinx thegreatpyramid جيزة بلاتي جيزةبلاتي davidholt davidholtlondon" title="288.

<photo  date_taken="2009-05-24 09:14:17" description="Egypt officially the Arab Republic of Egypt, is a country mainly in North Africa, with the Sinai Peninsula forming a land bridge in Western Asia. Covering an area of about 1,010,000 square kilometers (390,000 sq mi), Egypt is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast, the Red Sea to the east, Sudan to the south and Libya to the west. Egypt is one of the most populous countries in Africa and the Middle East. The great majority of its estimated 76 million live near the banks of the Nile River, in an area of about 40,000 square kilometers (15,000 sq mi), where the only arable agricultural land is found. The large areas of the Sahara Desert are sparsely inhabited. About half of Egypt's residents live in urban areas, with the majority spread across the densely-populated centres of greater Cairo, Alexandria and other major cities in the Nile Delta. Egypt is famous for its ancient civilization and some of the world's most famous monuments, including the Giza pyramid complex and its Great Sphinx. The southern city of Luxor contains numerous ancient artifacts, such as the Karnak Temple and the Valley of the Kings. Egypt is widely regarded as an important political and cultural nation of the Middle East. Egypt possesses one of the most developed economies in the Middle East, with sectors such as tourism, agriculture, industry and service at almost equal rates in national production. Consequently, the Egyptian economy is rapidly developing, due in part to legislation aimed at luring investments, coupled with both internal and political stability, along with recent trade and market liberalization." id="3563905223" latitude="0" license="5" longitude="0" nbComments="0" rank="101" tags="africa africaday 2009 infomatique photographedbyinfomatique dublin iveaghgardens ireland streetsoddublin williammurphy liammurphy africaday2009 streetsofdublin" title="Africa Day 2009 - Egypt" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/3315/3563905223_06f484ecea_b.jpg" username="infomatique" views="209" />
<photo  date_taken="2009-09-10 19:27:28" description="The Luxor Las Vegas hotel, where we stayed. I must say I was impressed by the architecture. The outside is fairly simple, but the inside is something else. It's very striking to find that the pyramid is actually empty! There are rooms in the outter structure, but at the center is what is apparently the largest atrium in the world by volume. It's an open inside space high of some 30 stories. As if one world record wasn't enough, the hotel also claims the projector at the apex of the pyramid is the most powerful light worldwide. Las Vegas really is the city of extremes. The name &amp;quot;Luxor&amp;quot; is weird choice, as it's the modern name for the ancient city of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thebes_(Egypt)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Thebes&lt;/a&gt;.

My opinion is that &amp;quot;Luxor&amp;quot; was choosen because it sounds like &amp;quot;luxury&amp;quot;. It was a funny coincidence that my girlfriend was at the actual Luxor city while I stayed at this hotel. It wasn't planned, I swear! The exposure for this picture was difficult to balance to my tastes. To see the beam, I had to make the sky darker. I ended up overlaying multiple exposure.
