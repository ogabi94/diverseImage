Remembrance Day (Australia, Canada, United Kingdom), also known as Poppy Day (South Africa and Malta), and Armistice Day (United Kingdom, New Zealand and many other Commonwealth countries; and the original name of the holiday internationally) is a day to commemorate the sacrifice of veterans and civilians in World War I, World War II, and other wars. It is observed on November 11 to recall the end of World War I on that date in 1918. The observance is specifically dedicated to members of the armed forces who were killed during war, and was created by King George V of the United Kingdom on November 7, 1919, possibly upon the suggestion of Edward George Honey though Wellesley Tudor Pole, who established two ceremonial periods of remembrance based on events in 1917. In the United Kingdom, although two minutes' silence is observed on November 11 itself, the main observance is on the second Sunday of November, Remembrance Sunday. Ceremonies are held at local communities' War Memorials, usually organised by local branches of the Royal British Legion – an association for ex-servicemen. Typically, poppy wreaths are laid by local organisations including the Royal British Legion, ex-servicemen organisations, cadet forces, the Scouts, Guides, Boys' Brigade, St John Ambulance and the Salvation Army. &amp;quot;The Last Post&amp;quot; is played by a trumpeter or bugler, two minutes' silence is observed and broken by a trumpeter playing &amp;quot;Reveille&amp;quot;. A minute's or two minutes' silence is also frequently incorporated into church services on that day. The main commemoration is held in Whitehall in central London, where the Queen, Prime Minister, and other senior political and military figures join with veterans to lay wreaths at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/299905570/&quot;&gt;Cenotaph&lt;/a&gt;. The poppy's significance to Remembrance Day is a result of Canadian military physician John McCrae's poem In Flanders Fields. The poppy emblem was chosen because of the poppies that bloomed across some of the worst battlefields of Flanders in World War I, their red colour an appropriate symbol for the bloodshed of trench warfare. A Frenchwoman by the name of Madame E. Guérin introduced the widely used artificial poppies given out today. Some people choose to wear white poppies, which emphasises a desire for peaceful alternatives to military action. Until 1996, poppies were made by disabled veterans in Canada, but they have since been made by a private contractor. In England, Wales,and Northern Ireland the poppies are the flat Earl Haig variety with a leaf. Wearers require a separate pin to attach the poppy to their clothing. Because the poppy honours British soldiers, in Northern Ireland it is worn primarily by members of the Unionist community." id="302732376" latitude="51.49986" license="3" longitude="-0.128021" nbComments="2" rank="14" tags="westminsterabbey uk unitedkingdom britain greatbritain londonist europe remembranceday cross poppy armistaceday remembrancday collegiatechurchofstpeterwestminster collegiatechurchofstpeter cathedral church unesco unescoworldheritage worldheritage worldheritagesite unescoworldheritagesite warmemorial london england" title="UK -  London - Westminster: Westminster Abbey - Remembrance Day" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/122/302732376_c0eb644932_b.jpg" username="wallyg" views="10777" />

<photo  date_taken="2011-09-11 10:33:18" description="From U.S. Ambassador Huebner's Blog Post: &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.newzealand.usembassy.gov/ambassador/2011/09/commemorating-the-tenth-anniversary-of-9-11/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;blogs.newzealand.usembassy.gov/ambassador/2011/09/commemo...&lt;/a&gt; Today I had the solemn honor of participating in a memorial service to commemorate the tenth anniversary of 9-11, at St Andrew’s Church in New Plymouth. Led by my friend the Reverend Kim Francis, the memorial drew more than 500 Kiwis, Americans, Irish, and others to pray, sing, remember, and show solidarity. Our Marine Band joined St Andrew’s choir to provide music. I was joined at the front of the congregation by the entire USA Eagles team and other special friends including Mayor Harry Duynhoven and the Mayoress, MP Jonathan Young, and my colleagues Ambassador Frankie Reed, Special Representative Reta Jo Lewis, and ANP Desk Officer Michele Petersen. Today is a challenging day, but the juxtaposition of solemn remembrance and exuberant sport is not as discordant as it may seem at first blush. It is essential that we remember the 3,000 people murdered on 9-11, but it is equally essential that we celebrate the resilience of the human spirit and the courage and strength of communities visited by tragedy. So we carry on. Pastor Francis asked me to speak at the service. My colleagues suggested that I share my remarks with you, so here they are: * * * There are rare days, maybe once every few generations, that galvanize the collective hearts and minds of humanity. Days that dispel in a flash the billions of distractions of everyday life … that boil off, even if only temporarily, the political, religious, national, and cultural pretenses that we humans create to separate ourselves from each other. Days that resonate deep inside us where the common core of our humanity exists, rather than on the surface where we live most of our earthly life. 9–11 was one of those days. We watched live on television the brutal murders of 3,000 human beings from 90 different nations. They were people of all religious beliefs, all political viewpoints, young and old, men and women, gay and straight. They were murdered by those preaching hatred, simply to instill fear. And we reacted with near unanimous horror and sorrow. The perpetrators of the carnage would wish us to relive that horror and feel that fear as we mark the tenth anniversary of the events of September 11, 2001. What we commemorate today, however, is not the fact that remorseless evil lives among us, something that even the most blinkered moral relativist already knows in his heart. Instead, we commemorate the triumph of the human spirit … the common humanity, empathy, and self abnegation that set us apart from the other species on this planet. We commemorate those police, fire, and rescue workers who raced into – rather than out of – collapsing buildings. We commemorate those regular citizens who carried – rather than trampled – strangers as they themselves struggled down burning, smoke-filled, crumbling stairwells. We commemorate the passengers of United Flight 93, including two American rugby players, who battled the hijackers in the aisle with coffee pots, cutlery, and shoes, broke into the cockpit, and crashed the airplane into a field in Pennsylvania, thus averting the destruction of the terrorists’ intended target, this planet’s iconic symbol of democratic self-determination, the US Capitol Building. We commemorate those who survived the attacks, including my brother Rick, who was at the South Tower when the airplanes struck the World Trade Center. And we remember all those we lost and their families and loved ones … not only those lost in the American Northeast on that day but all those lost on other days in Madrid, London, Bali, Nairobi, Dar es Salaam, Mumbai, Oklahoma City, Oslo, Jakarta, Manila, Kabul, Lahore, Baghdad, Kigali, and far too many other towns and cities. But today, beyond sadness, we also commemorate, honor, and indeed celebrate the resilience and determination of communities around the world that have suffered attacks by violent extremists … communities that have pulled together and demonstrated that they are stronger than fear. We commemorate, honor, and indeed celebrate the many people around the world working to prevent new attacks, to confront and overcome violent ideologies, and to address and combat the circumstances that create breeding grounds for violent extremism. And finally, and I think most importantly, we commemorate, honor, and indeed celebrate what violent extremists themselves fear most: the great human instinct toward empathy, kindness, and solidarity. As I find is often the case, the most trenchant commentary comes not from those who peddle words for a living. And the best example is found not among those who presume to lead from a safe, comfortable, and convenient distance. I look somewhere quite different for inspiration and hope. In the days following September 11, 2001, our Embassy received an email from a Wellington mum sharing the following story: “My son TK (who will be 4 years old next week) watched as the American flag outside the American Embassy was put to half mast yesterday morning. The Embassy is across the road from TK’s crèche, and after the flag was lowered, he asked why. “His teachers explained to him that it was because lots of people had been hurt, and then the teachers suggested that the children take flowers over to the Embassy as a mark of respect. “TK proudly carries his purple flowers forward and placed them beside the flag, then stood back and waited while his friends did the same. He waited, eyes on the flag. When his teachers told him it was time to go, he started crying. The teacher asked what the matter was. TK had thought that by putting the flowers under the flag that would make the people better and the flag would therefore rise again. “TK was sad that the flowers didn’t help, so he also made 2 cardboard airplanes and asked me to send them to replace the ones that the bad men had broken.” TK’s mum went on to say that she sent an email to United Airlines telling them about TK’s cardboard planes and offering her condolences. That email was circulated widely within the company, and a line manager in Chicago sent back an email saying: “Touched does not begin to explain how I feel. During these hard times for us all, it helps to see the hope and goodness in our future generation. Your son must have a very kind heart.” Yes, TK does have a very kind heart. And he’s not alone. There are millions of TKs out there, and they stepped up on the darkest of days when we needed them most. It is in nurturing, protecting, and empowering those kind hearts that we find our best hope for building a positive legacy from the events we remember here today. He aha te mea nui?

Days that dispel in a flash the billions of distractions of everyday life … that boil off, even if only temporarily, the political, religious, national, and cultural pretenses that we humans create to separate ourselves from each other. Days that resonate deep inside us where the common core of our humanity exists, rather than on the surface where we live most of our earthly life. 9–11 was one of those days. We watched live on television the brutal murders of 3,000 human beings from 90 different nations. They were people of all religious beliefs, all political viewpoints, young and old, men and women, gay and straight. They were murdered by those preaching hatred, simply to instill fear. And we reacted with near unanimous horror and sorrow. The perpetrators of the carnage would wish us to relive that horror and feel that fear as we mark the tenth anniversary of the events of September 11, 2001. What we commemorate today, however, is not the fact that remorseless evil lives among us, something that even the most blinkered moral relativist already knows in his heart. Instead, we commemorate the triumph of the human spirit … the common humanity, empathy, and self abnegation that set us apart from the other species on this planet. We commemorate those police, fire, and rescue workers who raced into – rather than out of – collapsing buildings. We commemorate those regular citizens who carried – rather than trampled – strangers as they themselves struggled down burning, smoke-filled, crumbling stairwells. We commemorate the passengers of United Flight 93, including two American rugby players, who battled the hijackers in the aisle with coffee pots, cutlery, and shoes, broke into the cockpit, and crashed the airplane into a field in Pennsylvania, thus averting the destruction of the terrorists’ intended target, this planet’s iconic symbol of democratic self-determination, the US Capitol Building. We commemorate those who survived the attacks, including my brother Rick, who was at the South Tower when the airplanes struck the World Trade Center. And we remember all those we lost and their families and loved ones … not only those lost in the American Northeast on that day but all those lost on other days in Madrid, London, Bali, Nairobi, Dar es Salaam, Mumbai, Oklahoma City, Oslo, Jakarta, Manila, Kabul, Lahore, Baghdad, Kigali, and far too many other towns and cities. But today, beyond sadness, we also commemorate, honor, and indeed celebrate the resilience and determination of communities around the world that have suffered attacks by violent extremists … communities that have pulled together and demonstrated that they are stronger than fear. We commemorate, honor, and indeed celebrate the many people around the world working to prevent new attacks, to confront and overcome violent ideologies, and to address and combat the circumstances that create breeding grounds for violent extremism. And finally, and I think most importantly, we commemorate, honor, and indeed celebrate what violent extremists themselves fear most: the great human instinct toward empathy, kindness, and solidarity. As I find is often the case, the most trenchant commentary comes not from those who peddle words for a living. And the best example is found not among those who presume to lead from a safe, comfortable, and convenient distance. I look somewhere quite different for inspiration and hope. In the days following September 11, 2001, our Embassy received an email from a Wellington mum sharing the following story: “My son TK (who will be 4 years old next week) watched as the American flag outside the American Embassy was put to half mast yesterday morning. The Embassy is across the road from TK’s crèche, and after the flag was lowered, he asked why. “His teachers explained to him that it was because lots of people had been hurt, and then the teachers suggested that the children take flowers over to the Embassy as a mark of respect. “TK proudly carries his purple flowers forward and placed them beside the flag, then stood back and waited while his friends did the same. He waited, eyes on the flag. When his teachers told him it was time to go, he started crying. The teacher asked what the matter was. TK had thought that by putting the flowers under the flag that would make the people better and the flag would therefore rise again. “TK was sad that the flowers didn’t help, so he also made 2 cardboard airplanes and asked me to send them to replace the ones that the bad men had broken.” TK’s mum went on to say that she sent an email to United Airlines telling them about TK’s cardboard planes and offering her condolences. That email was circulated widely within the company, and a line manager in Chicago sent back an email saying: “Touched does not begin to explain how I feel. During these hard times for us all, it helps to see the hope and goodness in our future generation. Your son must have a very kind heart.” Yes, TK does have a very kind heart. And he’s not alone. There are millions of TKs out there, and they stepped up on the darkest of days when we needed them most. It is in nurturing, protecting, and empowering those kind hearts that we find our best hope for building a positive legacy from the events we remember here today. He aha te mea nui?

Led by my friend the Reverend Kim Francis, the memorial drew more than 500 Kiwis, Americans, Irish, and others to pray, sing, remember, and show solidarity. Our Marine Band joined St Andrew’s choir to provide music. I was joined at the front of the congregation by the entire USA Eagles team and other special friends including Mayor Harry Duynhoven and the Mayoress, MP Jonathan Young, and my colleagues Ambassador Frankie Reed, Special Representative Reta Jo Lewis, and ANP Desk Officer Michele Petersen. Today is a challenging day, but the juxtaposition of solemn remembrance and exuberant sport is not as discordant as it may seem at first blush. It is essential that we remember the 3,000 people murdered on 9-11, but it is equally essential that we celebrate the resilience of the human spirit and the courage and strength of communities visited by tragedy.

As I find is often the case, the most trenchant commentary comes not from those who peddle words for a living. And the best example is found not among those who presume to lead from a safe, comfortable, and convenient distance. I look somewhere quite different for inspiration and hope. In the days following September 11, 2001, our Embassy received an email from a Wellington mum sharing the following story: “My son TK (who will be 4 years old next week) watched as the American flag outside the American Embassy was put to half mast yesterday morning. The Embassy is across the road from TK’s crèche, and after the flag was lowered, he asked why. “His teachers explained to him that it was because lots of people had been hurt, and then the teachers suggested that the children take flowers over to the Embassy as a mark of respect. “TK proudly carries his purple flowers forward and placed them beside the flag, then stood back and waited while his friends did the same. He waited, eyes on the flag. When his teachers told him it was time to go, he started crying. The teacher asked what the matter was. TK had thought that by putting the flowers under the flag that would make the people better and the flag would therefore rise again. “TK was sad that the flowers didn’t help, so he also made 2 cardboard airplanes and asked me to send them to replace the ones that the bad men had broken.” TK’s mum went on to say that she sent an email to United Airlines telling them about TK’s cardboard planes and offering her condolences. That email was circulated widely within the company, and a line manager in Chicago sent back an email saying: “Touched does not begin to explain how I feel. During these hard times for us all, it helps to see the hope and goodness in our future generation. Your son must have a very kind heart.” Yes, TK does have a very kind heart. And he’s not alone. There are millions of TKs out there, and they stepped up on the darkest of days when we needed them most. It is in nurturing, protecting, and empowering those kind hearts that we find our best hope for building a positive legacy from the events we remember here today. He aha te mea nui? He tangata, he tangata, he tangata. Kati ake i konei. Ma te Atua koutou e manaaki. &lt;a href=&quot;http://newzealand.usembassy.gov/911_remarks.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;newzealand.usembassy.gov/911_remarks.html&lt;/a&gt;" id="6134746894" latitude="-39.059183" license="6" longitude="174.077124" nbComments="0" rank="32" tags="911memorialservice septermer11 10thanniversaryof911 newplymouth eagelsrugby rugby rwc taranakiinternationalvillage pukekurapark fanzone oldstpaul’s stratfordwarmemorialhall tvnz usmarinecorpsforcespacificband marines usamarines usembassywellinton newzealand usambassadorhuebner" title="10th Anniversary of 9-11.

The formation will be flying down the Mall as the Royal Family watch from the balcony of Buckingham Palace. The Flypast will include the Dakota flanked by two King Air aircraft, a Lancaster, Spitfires and a Hurricane from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, ahead of the Red Arrows who will make their entrance seconds later. Officer in Command of the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, Squadron Leader Ian Smith said: âThe Royal Air Force Battle of Britain Memorial Flight are honoured to be leading the Flypast for Her Majesty the Queenâs Diamond Jubilee celebrations. âAs a Service the RAF is enormously proud of its heritage, and the opportunity to fly over Buckingham Palace for Her Majesty with the nationâs aviation heritage is something that will remain with us for the rest of our livesâ. The Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (originally named simply the Historic Aircraft Flight) was founded in 1957 to commemorate the personnel of the Royal Air Force who have served their country in conflict, particularly during World War Two. King Airs are the multi-engine training aircraft of the Royal Air Force, flown by 45 (Reserve) Squadron which is part of Number 3 Flying Training School based at RAF Cranwell. Once pilots have successfully completed multi-engine pilot training on 45 (R) Squadron they are awarded their coveted pilotâs wings, and then undertake conversion to their frontline multi-engine aircraft type at an Operational Conversion Unit. Leading the nine Red Arrows following the Memorial Flight and closing the ceremonies will be Squadron Leader Jim Turner in Red 1. âWe are all extremely proud to be part of this auspicious event and to be a part of aircraft from the Royal Air Force at this tri-service celebration. âWe would like to offer our congratulations to Her Majesty on the occasion of her Diamond Jubileeâ.Â ENDS Notes to Editors For further information please contact: Meg Fairhurst RAF Media &amp;amp; Comms HQ Air Command Royal Air Force High Wycombe Mil Tel: 95221 3841 Civ Tel: 01494 493841 Â DII(F): Air-XO-M&amp;amp;C Media Proj 5Â CivÂ Email: meg.fairhurst100@mod.uk Â Â Battle of Britain Memorial flight (BBMF) Based at RAF Coningsby The Royal Air Force Battle of Britain Memorial Flight exists to commemorate the personnel of the Royal Air Force who have served their country in conflict, particularly during World War Two, and especially those who gave their lives for the freedom of others. The Flightâs fleet of World War Two aircraft is preserved in flying condition as a living tribute to them all. The patron of the flight is His Royal Highness The Duke of Cambridge KG who also serves in the RAFâs Search and Rescue Force. Since their formation in July 1957, BBMF have completed thousands of displays and tens of thousands of fly-pasts; proud to represent the nationâs aviation heritage. They are a large Flight within the Royal Air Force and are extremely proud of not only their history, but their continued engagement in operations abroad. The Royal Air Force continues to police the skies above our country, much like the fighters of the Flight did some 70 years ago. BBMF are a &amp;quot;museum without walls&amp;quot; and a &amp;quot;living and breathing tribute&amp;quot; to those who paid the ultimate sacrifice. Records show that for many years after its formation the Flight conducted relatively low-key operations; typically making 50-60 appearances per season, a situation that continued into the mid-1960s. By the early 1990s this had trebled and demand for participation by the Flightâs aircraft was continuing to grow. In 1996 individual aircraft appearances exceeded 500 and by 2003 tasking for over 700 individual aircraft appearances during each yearâs display season had become the norm. The demand for appearances by the Flightâs aircraft shows no sign of decline and indeed seems to increase every year. The Flightâs aircraft now appear in front of an estimated total audience of 7 million people annually and have a fleet of 12 airworthy aircraft. The Red Arrows Based at RAF Scampton Aircraft: Hawk T1 Base: RAF Scampton, Lincolnshire Role: The Hawk T1 has been used by the Red Arrows since 1979, replacing the Folland Gnat. The Hawkâs Rolls Royce Adour engine produces 5,200lbs of thrust and can power the aircraft to a top speed of Mach 1.2. The aircraft has a maximum altitude of 48,000 ft and fuel capacity gives a range of 1,000 nm, making most of the world accessible apart from New Zealand. The aircraft are essentially the same as those flown by Advanced Flying Training students at Royal Air Force Valley, with the exception of smoke generation modifications and a slightly updated engine which gives a faster response time. The smoke generation system pumps diesel mixed with appropriately colored dye into the jet exhaust to produce the colorful vapour trails that the Red Arrows are famous for. These trails are used mainly for flight safety reasons so the pilots can judge wind speed and direction whilst performing their displays. However, the effects of the trails also look good, enhancing the show for the audience on the ground. Each aircraft can carry enough diesel and dye to create five minutes of white smoke, one minute of red and one minute of blue during the display. All nine Red Arrows display pilots are fast jet pilots from frontline Royal Air Force squadrons and once they have finished their three-year tour with the Team they will return to their Royal Air Force duties. To apply for selection to the Team, pilots must first meet certain criteria: * They must have a minimum of 1,500 flying hours. * They must have completed a frontline tour. * Be assessed as being above average in their flying role. The flying team is supported by 85 engineering technicians and other support staff who are known as the âThe Bluesâ because they wear distinctive royal blue flying suits during the display season. The Blues represent nine out of the Royal Air Forceâs broad range of more than 65 technical and non-technical trades. Every team member has undergone intensive training in their particular specialisation throughout their Royal Air Force career. 2012 is the 48th display season for the Red Arrows in which they will continue to enthral, captivate and inspire millions of people both in the UK and around the world with a series of over 70 displays and flypasts at a wide variety of events. King Air Based at RAF Cranwell The Beech King Air B200 is a twin-engine fixed wing aircraft, which first entered RAF service in 2004. It is used as an advanced, multi-engine pilot trainer by No 45(R) Squadron, which is part of No 3 Flying Training School based at RAF Cranwell, in Lincolnshire. The King Air course is split into basic and advanced phases. In the basic phase, students learn essential multi-engine techniques such as general handling, asymmetric flying, emergency handling and radio-aids navigation, and consolidate the multi-crew skills acquired on previous courses. In the advanced phase, the emphasis shifts towards developing captaincy, crew resource management, and managing the King Air's advanced avionics systems. Students learn advanced skills such as formation flying, low-level flying and airways navigation, and are expected to plan and manage missions involving several aircraft. Please note BBMF aircraft and the fly past formation are subject to change.

He had been warned in 1796 that if he chose to plant crops &amp;quot;on the avenue and the Mall&amp;quot;, it was at his own risk as something might be done &amp;quot;almost any time&amp;quot; to make a thoroughfare.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; It is probable that &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Thomas Jefferson&lt;/a&gt; was the first influential person who took an interest in cleaning up the brush that covered the land. By 1810, some rows of Lombardy poplars had been planted, however, the avenue itself &amp;quot;was too much of a morass&amp;quot; to be traversed on horseback.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Botanic Garden of the Columbian Institute&lt;/i&gt; One of the greatest accomplishments of the institution was the creation of a botanic garden in 1821. &amp;quot;By the end of 1823 the swampy tract of land granted by Congress had been drained and leveled, an elliptical pond with an island at its center constructed, and four graveled walks laid out. Trees and shrubs were planted, and the garden was maintained as well as scanty funds would permit until the institute expired in 1837, one year before the termination of its charter.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-botanical-3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; On May 26, 1824, the grounds were extended and in 1825, they were enclosed. &amp;quot;There seems to be no record of what improvements or plantings were made by the Columbian Institute. The institute had expended $1,500 on the grounds for walks and plantings and had asked Congress to be reimbursed, but this request was not granted.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-elliott-6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt; Although the membership roster of the Columbian Institution included many distinguished citizens and several presidents, they were unable to raise money for the greenhouse and lecture hall.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; Meetings were held in a variety of temporary offices, including a committee room in the capitol building that Congress granted use of on December 20, 1828.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-rooms-10&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[11]&lt;/a&gt; Despite all the hardships, the Institute quickly launched an enthusiastic effort to collect plants and seeds.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; In 1826, a committee was appointed to meet with heads of government departments to help solicit &amp;quot;all subjects of natural history that may be deemed interesting&amp;quot; from foreign representatives. The following year, Secretary of the Treasury, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Rush&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Richard Rush&lt;/a&gt; was also involved in the solicitation by circulating a letter to foreign dignitaries.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; In the letter he stated that President &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;John Quincy Adams&lt;/a&gt; was &amp;quot;desirous of causing to be introduced into the United States all such trees and plants from other countries not heretofore known in the United States, as may give promise, under proper cultivation, of flourishing and becoming useful....&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; The publicity was extremely successful. Plants and seeds made their way to the Institute from as far away as China and Brazil. Some came from areas nearby, such as Montgomery County in Maryland. In 1824, a &lt;i&gt;List of Plants in the Botanic Garden of the Columbian Institute&lt;/i&gt; was prepared by William Elliot.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; The pamphlet mentioned more than 458 plants growing at that time.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-elliott-6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt; Sixteen years passed and by 1836, no further improvements had been made on the property. &amp;quot;The tract was a stagnant and malarial swamp and Congress was prevailed upon to make an appropriation of $5,000 for improvements.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-improvements-11&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[12]&lt;/a&gt; The funds were used to drain the site and erect a fountain.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; Financial woes continued to plague the Institute, and there was &amp;quot;never enough money from contributions for proper maintenance of the garden and plant collections.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; The facility ceased to operate in 1837 when the society stopped holding meetings. However it was re-instituted in 1842 when the Wilkes expedition of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ocean&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt; brought back a collection of plants.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Wilkes exploring and surveying expedition&lt;/i&gt; In 1838, Lt. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Wilkes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Charles Wilkes&lt;/a&gt; set out on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Exploring_Expedition&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;United States Exploring Expedition&lt;/a&gt; commissioned by Congress&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumnavigation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;circumnavigate&lt;/a&gt; the globe and explore the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; Between the years 1838–1842, the expedition, consisting of six government ships, traveled 87,000 miles&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-garden-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; and collected a large assortment of horticultural and botanical specimens. These formed the nucleus of the present garden.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The expedition also confirmed that Antarctica was a continent.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-garden-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; The staff included a botanist, W. D. Breckenridge who brought back a large collection of specimens, including seeds and cuttings.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-improvements-11&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[12]&lt;/a&gt; Because the garden was situated in a swamp, early attempts at cultivation were not successful, however, during 1842; a revival was made after the Wilkes Expedition brought many rare plants to Washington from the Fiji, Sandwich and Society Islands, New Zealand and South America. During this trip, Wilkes collected live and dried &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;specimens&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;plants&lt;/a&gt; and was one of the first to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardian_case&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;wardian cases&lt;/a&gt; to maintain live plants on long voyages. Members of the expedition returned with a massive collection of plants previously unknown in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The dried specimens comprised the core of what is now the &lt;b&gt;National Herbarium&lt;/b&gt;, an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbarium&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;herbarium&lt;/a&gt; curated by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Smithsonian Institution's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_Natural_History&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;National Museum of Natural History&lt;/a&gt;. The live Wilkes specimens and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;seeds&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;were transferred successively to frames in 1844 and to the Old Patent Office greenhouse, the first building on the site, where they remained until 1850.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-swamp-5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt; At that time, a botanic garden was built to house the collection in front of the Capitol, where the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflecting_pool&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reflecting pool&lt;/a&gt; is now located. They were moved again in 1934.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-swamp-5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;U.S. Botanic Garden&lt;/i&gt; The very tract of land the Botanical Garden of the Columbian Institute occupied, became the site of the United States Botanic Garden, established in 1850, thirteen years after the demise of the institute. In 1867, Congress provided money for the construction of the first greenhouses. The main conservatory building was erected, 30 feet long with a dome 60 feet high.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; Several historic trees stood on the site including the &lt;i&gt;Crittenden Oak&lt;/i&gt; which marks the spot where &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_J._Crittenden&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;John J. Crittenden&lt;/a&gt; made an address in an effort to avert the Civil War. Also, &lt;i&gt;the Beck-Washington Elm&lt;/i&gt; was a scion of an elm earlier planted by Washington himself. A plane tree which &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaddeus_Stevens&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Thaddeus Stevens&lt;/a&gt; brought from the &lt;i&gt;Vale of Cashmere&lt;/i&gt;, a sycamore planted by Senator &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Voorhees&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Daniel Voorhees&lt;/a&gt; and a Chinese oak from the grave of Confucius, two cedars of Lebanon, and several others that have historic associations.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; The &lt;i&gt;Bartholdl Fountain&lt;/i&gt;, the work of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%c3%a9d%c3%a9ric_Auguste_Bartholdi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi&lt;/a&gt;, the same sculptor who designed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Liberty&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Statue of Liberty&lt;/a&gt; in New York Harbor stood in a central site in the gardens, however, it was placed in storage for several years to make way for the memorial to General Meade, the hero of Gettysburg.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; The garden &amp;quot;was formally placed under the jurisdiction of the Joint Committee on the Library of Congress in 1856 and has been administered through the Office of the Architect of the Capitol since 1934. The Architect of the Capitol has served as Acting Director of the United States Botanic Garden and is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the Garden and for any construction, changes, or improvements made.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-architect-13&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[14]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Talk of expansion and move&lt;/i&gt; A discussion about moving the garden began in Congress in August, 1922. &amp;quot;It appears likely that the public features of the present garden will be transferred from the west side of the Capitol to the north side and that a new botanic garden and arboretum on an adequate scale will be established not far from the Capitol.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The site of the original garden was fewer than 13&amp;nbsp;acres (53,000 m2), in comparison to the famous Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in London, which had 288&amp;nbsp;acres (1.17&amp;nbsp;km2). The garden in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin,_Germany&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Berlin, Germany&lt;/a&gt;, has over 1,325&amp;nbsp;acres (5.36&amp;nbsp;km2) and was established at a cost of over $4,000,000. In comparison, $1,416,748 was spent on the garden in Washington between the years 1842–1922. This included the original appropriation for the Wilkes expedition.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; Senate resolution 165 was passed and a committee was formed to review the acquisition of a new site. Lieut. Col. Clarence O. Sherrill, Corps of Engineers, secretary and executive officer of the fine arts commission, compiled a report on the garden.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; It was felt that the botanic garden must be removed because when Congress established the location of the Grant Memorial in the garden-area, technically, it forced the garden out. &amp;quot;Such was the intention of Congress.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The action was entirely logical. That space was designed by President &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;George Washington&lt;/a&gt; and Maj. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Charles_L'Enfant&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pierre Charles L'Enfant&lt;/a&gt; as an open approach to the Capitol, which is shown on the original plan to the city. &amp;quot;It was proposed at that time that this area should be subject to ornamentation with memorials, foundations, and the like, but not shut off by walls and fences. Locating the Botanic Garden in this area was one of those serious mistakes made in the early part of the century whereby the great plan for the Nation's Capital suffered damage that has continued to this day.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; Sherrill's report pointed out that the goal of Congress was to restore the Mall to its original status as a park connection between the legislative and executive departments. Congress had paid the Pennsylvania Railroad $1,500,000 to remove its tracks from the Mall. &amp;quot;The new National Museum Building, the Agriculture Department buildings, and the gallery for the Freer collections all have been located with reference in the general plan. Slowly, but steadily, changes in conformity with that plan are now being carried out throughout the entire 2½ miles from the Capitol Grounds to the Lincoln Memorial. The removal of the Botanic Garden is essential to the development of the great composition.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;If Congress desires to continue a garden for the purpose of obtaining flowers for its members and for growing shrubs to disseminate throughout the country, both of these purposes can be subserved quite as well by glass houses and gardens in other accessible locations.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; It was also felt that the new location would provide enlargement of the Capitol Grounds on the north which affords an area for gardens of great beauty and distinction &amp;quot;through which will pass all visitors to Washington and a large proportion of those persons who daily go to the Capitol and Library of Congress.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The old location was seen as assessable to only &amp;quot;an insignificant fraction of visitors or residents&amp;quot; and that the removal of the garden from the west side of the Capitol to the north side made the features of the garden more available.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; An exhaustive search was made of several areas available for garden purposes and Mount Hamilton, a privately owned site, was chosen. The tract fronted the Anacostia River and carried a variety of soils in such condition that &amp;quot;very little preparation for the uses of a botanic garden would be needed and very little grading other than that required for roads.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The tract had north, south, east and west slopes and a level area on Hickey Road that would work well for greenhouses and herbaceous gardens, while the other sloped areas would be ideal for shrub and small flowering-tree arboretum uses. The entire area contained about 400&amp;nbsp;acres (1.6&amp;nbsp;km2) and would &amp;quot;afford an entrance to Washington of unequaled beauty.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; In the future, it was felt that the garden could be expanded by &amp;quot;that portion of the park between the Pennsylvania Railroad and Benning Bridge contains about 563 acres, lowland and water, thus furnishing ample opportunity for expansion on land not subject to overflow for lowland and fresh-water exhibits.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The Commission of Fine Art made recommendation that the Mount Hamilton tract be acquired for a national botanic garden and arboretum; by purchasing 400&amp;nbsp;acres (1.6&amp;nbsp;km2) of land, at least 800&amp;nbsp;acres (3.2&amp;nbsp;km2) of Government-owned lands will be made available. Also, a park entrance to the city from the north will be provided. Additionally, the public features of the &amp;quot;present&amp;quot; Botanic Garden be transferred from the west side of the Capitol to the north side to lands already owned by the Government.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;New location&lt;/i&gt; In 1933, the main building was moved to its present location on the National Mall, just to the southwest of the Capitol, bordered by Maryland Avenue on the north, First Street on the east, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Avenue_(Washington_D.C.)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Independence Avenue&lt;/a&gt; on the south, and Third Street on the west.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-Botanic_Garden-2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; The facility includes a conservatory and 2&amp;nbsp;acres (8,100&amp;nbsp;m2) of outside grounds.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-14&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[15]&lt;/a&gt; Directly across Independence Avenue is Bartholdi Park, an outdoor display area, and an administration building.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-Botanic_Garden-2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-15&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[16]&lt;/a&gt; Located on 3&amp;nbsp;acres (12,000&amp;nbsp;m2) west of the conservatory and opened to the public on October 1, 2006, the National Garden provides living laboratories for environmental, horticultural, and botanical education.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-National_Garden-16&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[17]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-newsite-17&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[18]&lt;/a&gt; The major features of the National Garden are the Rose Garden, the Butterfly Garden, the Lawn Terrace, the First Ladies' Water Garden, the Regional Garden, and an outdoor amphitheater.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-National_Garden-16&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[17]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Plant production facility&lt;/i&gt; A plant production facility in Anacostia, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, includes greenhouse bays and a support facility for the garden. The &lt;i&gt;U.S. Botanic Garden Production Facility&lt;/i&gt;, covers 85,000&amp;nbsp;square feet (7,900&amp;nbsp;m2) under glass, and is the largest support facility for a botanic garden in the United States. It houses collections currently not on display, including plants recuperating. Seasonal plants are also grown at the facility for use in the Supreme Court, Library of Congress and for replenishing the Capitol grounds. An estimated 100,000 mums, pansies, cabbage, kale and other annuals and perennials per year are grown in the facility. Additionally, foliage plants for the Senate offices and palm trees for Capitol Hill events as well as special seasonal displays such as Easter lilies and poinsettias are all grown on site.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-production-0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;According to staff botanists, there are about 50,000 plants on hand at the production facility at any one time.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-production-0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Current operation&lt;/i&gt; Presently, the United States Botanic Garden is home to almost 10,000 living specimens, some of them over 165 years old.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-garden-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; The national monument was closed for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renovation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;renovations&lt;/a&gt; on September 1, 1997, and reopened to the public on December 11, 2001.

It is named for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartholdi_Fountain&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Bartholdi Fountain&lt;/a&gt; in the garden's center designed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%c3%a9d%c3%a9ric_Bartholdi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Frédéric Bartholdi&lt;/a&gt;. One of the goals of this garden is to provide inspiration and ideas for home gardeners who visit it. It displays a variety of small structured and non-structured gardens, and infuses color, shape, and planting themes. One section of the garden is certified as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Wildlife_Federation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;National Wildlife Federation&lt;/a&gt; Backyard Wildlife Habitat. The Park also houses the administrative building for the United States Botanic Garden. The Production Facility in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest,_Washington,_D.C.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;southwest D.C.&lt;/a&gt; is used for growing and storing plants for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_propagation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;propagation&lt;/a&gt;, for collection maintenance, or for display in upcoming annual shows. The USBG participates in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CITES&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CITES&lt;/a&gt; (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species), which means that it cares for plants seized by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Customs_and_Border_Protection&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Customs&lt;/a&gt;. It specializes in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchid&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;orchids&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succulents&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;succulents&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wilkes Plants&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; There are four plants in the garden that are believed to be directly related to the original &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilkes_Expedition&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wilkes Expedition&lt;/a&gt;. * The Vessel Fern (&lt;i&gt;Angiopteris evecta&lt;/i&gt;) situated in the Jungle, is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fern&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;fern&lt;/a&gt; believed to be the direct &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progeny_(genetic_descendant)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;progeny&lt;/a&gt; of the Vessel Fern brought back on Wilkes' ship. Because of the lifespan of Vessel Ferns, it is highly unlikely that the present fern is the original; however it is believed that the present fern is a direct descendant and genetically identical to the original. * The Ferocious Blue Cycad (&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalartos_horridus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Encephalartos horridus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycad&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cycad&lt;/a&gt; questionably one of the original Wilkes plants. Due to its size and possible age, some believe this plant to have come back with the expedition in 1842; unfortunately, early records are incomplete and inaccurate, so this is left to speculation. * The Queen Sagos &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycas_circinalis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cycas circinalis&lt;/a&gt;, which are cycads, live in the Garden Court. The Botanic Garden cares for both a male and a female of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;species&lt;/a&gt;, and both were brought back with the Wilkes Expedition. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;External links&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; * &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usbg.gov/index.cfm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;United States Botanic Garden&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;.

He had been warned in 1796 that if he chose to plant crops &amp;quot;on the avenue and the Mall&amp;quot;, it was at his own risk as something might be done &amp;quot;almost any time&amp;quot; to make a thoroughfare.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; It is probable that &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Thomas Jefferson&lt;/a&gt; was the first influential person who took an interest in cleaning up the brush that covered the land. By 1810, some rows of Lombardy poplars had been planted, however, the avenue itself &amp;quot;was too much of a morass&amp;quot; to be traversed on horseback.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Botanic Garden of the Columbian Institute&lt;/i&gt; One of the greatest accomplishments of the institution was the creation of a botanic garden in 1821. &amp;quot;By the end of 1823 the swampy tract of land granted by Congress had been drained and leveled, an elliptical pond with an island at its center constructed, and four graveled walks laid out. Trees and shrubs were planted, and the garden was maintained as well as scanty funds would permit until the institute expired in 1837, one year before the termination of its charter.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-botanical-3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; On May 26, 1824, the grounds were extended and in 1825, they were enclosed. &amp;quot;There seems to be no record of what improvements or plantings were made by the Columbian Institute. The institute had expended $1,500 on the grounds for walks and plantings and had asked Congress to be reimbursed, but this request was not granted.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-elliott-6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt; Although the membership roster of the Columbian Institution included many distinguished citizens and several presidents, they were unable to raise money for the greenhouse and lecture hall.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; Meetings were held in a variety of temporary offices, including a committee room in the capitol building that Congress granted use of on December 20, 1828.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-rooms-10&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[11]&lt;/a&gt; Despite all the hardships, the Institute quickly launched an enthusiastic effort to collect plants and seeds.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; In 1826, a committee was appointed to meet with heads of government departments to help solicit &amp;quot;all subjects of natural history that may be deemed interesting&amp;quot; from foreign representatives. The following year, Secretary of the Treasury, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Rush&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Richard Rush&lt;/a&gt; was also involved in the solicitation by circulating a letter to foreign dignitaries.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; In the letter he stated that President &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;John Quincy Adams&lt;/a&gt; was &amp;quot;desirous of causing to be introduced into the United States all such trees and plants from other countries not heretofore known in the United States, as may give promise, under proper cultivation, of flourishing and becoming useful....&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; The publicity was extremely successful. Plants and seeds made their way to the Institute from as far away as China and Brazil. Some came from areas nearby, such as Montgomery County in Maryland. In 1824, a &lt;i&gt;List of Plants in the Botanic Garden of the Columbian Institute&lt;/i&gt; was prepared by William Elliot.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; The pamphlet mentioned more than 458 plants growing at that time.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-elliott-6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt; Sixteen years passed and by 1836, no further improvements had been made on the property. &amp;quot;The tract was a stagnant and malarial swamp and Congress was prevailed upon to make an appropriation of $5,000 for improvements.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-improvements-11&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[12]&lt;/a&gt; The funds were used to drain the site and erect a fountain.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; Financial woes continued to plague the Institute, and there was &amp;quot;never enough money from contributions for proper maintenance of the garden and plant collections.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; The facility ceased to operate in 1837 when the society stopped holding meetings. However it was re-instituted in 1842 when the Wilkes expedition of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ocean&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt; brought back a collection of plants.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Wilkes exploring and surveying expedition&lt;/i&gt; In 1838, Lt. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Wilkes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Charles Wilkes&lt;/a&gt; set out on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Exploring_Expedition&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;United States Exploring Expedition&lt;/a&gt; commissioned by Congress&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumnavigation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;circumnavigate&lt;/a&gt; the globe and explore the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; Between the years 1838–1842, the expedition, consisting of six government ships, traveled 87,000 miles&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-garden-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; and collected a large assortment of horticultural and botanical specimens. These formed the nucleus of the present garden.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The expedition also confirmed that Antarctica was a continent.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-garden-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; The staff included a botanist, W. D. Breckenridge who brought back a large collection of specimens, including seeds and cuttings.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-improvements-11&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[12]&lt;/a&gt; Because the garden was situated in a swamp, early attempts at cultivation were not successful, however, during 1842; a revival was made after the Wilkes Expedition brought many rare plants to Washington from the Fiji, Sandwich and Society Islands, New Zealand and South America. During this trip, Wilkes collected live and dried &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;specimens&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;plants&lt;/a&gt; and was one of the first to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardian_case&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;wardian cases&lt;/a&gt; to maintain live plants on long voyages. Members of the expedition returned with a massive collection of plants previously unknown in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The dried specimens comprised the core of what is now the &lt;b&gt;National Herbarium&lt;/b&gt;, an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbarium&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;herbarium&lt;/a&gt; curated by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Smithsonian Institution's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_Natural_History&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;National Museum of Natural History&lt;/a&gt;. The live Wilkes specimens and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;seeds&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;were transferred successively to frames in 1844 and to the Old Patent Office greenhouse, the first building on the site, where they remained until 1850.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-swamp-5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt; At that time, a botanic garden was built to house the collection in front of the Capitol, where the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflecting_pool&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reflecting pool&lt;/a&gt; is now located. They were moved again in 1934.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-swamp-5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;U.S. Botanic Garden&lt;/i&gt; The very tract of land the Botanical Garden of the Columbian Institute occupied, became the site of the United States Botanic Garden, established in 1850, thirteen years after the demise of the institute. In 1867, Congress provided money for the construction of the first greenhouses. The main conservatory building was erected, 30 feet long with a dome 60 feet high.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; Several historic trees stood on the site including the &lt;i&gt;Crittenden Oak&lt;/i&gt; which marks the spot where &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_J._Crittenden&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;John J. Crittenden&lt;/a&gt; made an address in an effort to avert the Civil War. Also, &lt;i&gt;the Beck-Washington Elm&lt;/i&gt; was a scion of an elm earlier planted by Washington himself.

The Architect of the Capitol has served as Acting Director of the United States Botanic Garden and is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the Garden and for any construction, changes, or improvements made.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-architect-13&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[14]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Talk of expansion and move&lt;/i&gt; A discussion about moving the garden began in Congress in August, 1922. &amp;quot;It appears likely that the public features of the present garden will be transferred from the west side of the Capitol to the north side and that a new botanic garden and arboretum on an adequate scale will be established not far from the Capitol.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The site of the original garden was fewer than 13&amp;nbsp;acres (53,000 m2), in comparison to the famous Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in London, which had 288&amp;nbsp;acres (1.17&amp;nbsp;km2). The garden in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin,_Germany&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Berlin, Germany&lt;/a&gt;, has over 1,325&amp;nbsp;acres (5.36&amp;nbsp;km2) and was established at a cost of over $4,000,000. In comparison, $1,416,748 was spent on the garden in Washington between the years 1842–1922. This included the original appropriation for the Wilkes expedition.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; Senate resolution 165 was passed and a committee was formed to review the acquisition of a new site. Lieut. Col. Clarence O. Sherrill, Corps of Engineers, secretary and executive officer of the fine arts commission, compiled a report on the garden.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; It was felt that the botanic garden must be removed because when Congress established the location of the Grant Memorial in the garden-area, technically, it forced the garden out. &amp;quot;Such was the intention of Congress.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The action was entirely logical. That space was designed by President &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;George Washington&lt;/a&gt; and Maj. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Charles_L'Enfant&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pierre Charles L'Enfant&lt;/a&gt; as an open approach to the Capitol, which is shown on the original plan to the city. &amp;quot;It was proposed at that time that this area should be subject to ornamentation with memorials, foundations, and the like, but not shut off by walls and fences. Locating the Botanic Garden in this area was one of those serious mistakes made in the early part of the century whereby the great plan for the Nation's Capital suffered damage that has continued to this day.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; Sherrill's report pointed out that the goal of Congress was to restore the Mall to its original status as a park connection between the legislative and executive departments. Congress had paid the Pennsylvania Railroad $1,500,000 to remove its tracks from the Mall. &amp;quot;The new National Museum Building, the Agriculture Department buildings, and the gallery for the Freer collections all have been located with reference in the general plan. Slowly, but steadily, changes in conformity with that plan are now being carried out throughout the entire 2½ miles from the Capitol Grounds to the Lincoln Memorial. The removal of the Botanic Garden is essential to the development of the great composition.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;If Congress desires to continue a garden for the purpose of obtaining flowers for its members and for growing shrubs to disseminate throughout the country, both of these purposes can be subserved quite as well by glass houses and gardens in other accessible locations.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; It was also felt that the new location would provide enlargement of the Capitol Grounds on the north which affords an area for gardens of great beauty and distinction &amp;quot;through which will pass all visitors to Washington and a large proportion of those persons who daily go to the Capitol and Library of Congress.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The old location was seen as assessable to only &amp;quot;an insignificant fraction of visitors or residents&amp;quot; and that the removal of the garden from the west side of the Capitol to the north side made the features of the garden more available.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; An exhaustive search was made of several areas available for garden purposes and Mount Hamilton, a privately owned site, was chosen. The tract fronted the Anacostia River and carried a variety of soils in such condition that &amp;quot;very little preparation for the uses of a botanic garden would be needed and very little grading other than that required for roads.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The tract had north, south, east and west slopes and a level area on Hickey Road that would work well for greenhouses and herbaceous gardens, while the other sloped areas would be ideal for shrub and small flowering-tree arboretum uses. The entire area contained about 400&amp;nbsp;acres (1.6&amp;nbsp;km2) and would &amp;quot;afford an entrance to Washington of unequaled beauty.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; In the future, it was felt that the garden could be expanded by &amp;quot;that portion of the park between the Pennsylvania Railroad and Benning Bridge contains about 563 acres, lowland and water, thus furnishing ample opportunity for expansion on land not subject to overflow for lowland and fresh-water exhibits.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The Commission of Fine Art made recommendation that the Mount Hamilton tract be acquired for a national botanic garden and arboretum; by purchasing 400&amp;nbsp;acres (1.6&amp;nbsp;km2) of land, at least 800&amp;nbsp;acres (3.2&amp;nbsp;km2) of Government-owned lands will be made available. Also, a park entrance to the city from the north will be provided. Additionally, the public features of the &amp;quot;present&amp;quot; Botanic Garden be transferred from the west side of the Capitol to the north side to lands already owned by the Government.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;New location&lt;/i&gt; In 1933, the main building was moved to its present location on the National Mall, just to the southwest of the Capitol, bordered by Maryland Avenue on the north, First Street on the east, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Avenue_(Washington_D.C.)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Independence Avenue&lt;/a&gt; on the south, and Third Street on the west.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-Botanic_Garden-2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; The facility includes a conservatory and 2&amp;nbsp;acres (8,100&amp;nbsp;m2) of outside grounds.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-14&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[15]&lt;/a&gt; Directly across Independence Avenue is Bartholdi Park, an outdoor display area, and an administration building.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-Botanic_Garden-2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-15&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[16]&lt;/a&gt; Located on 3&amp;nbsp;acres (12,000&amp;nbsp;m2) west of the conservatory and opened to the public on October 1, 2006, the National Garden provides living laboratories for environmental, horticultural, and botanical education.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-National_Garden-16&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[17]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-newsite-17&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[18]&lt;/a&gt; The major features of the National Garden are the Rose Garden, the Butterfly Garden, the Lawn Terrace, the First Ladies' Water Garden, the Regional Garden, and an outdoor amphitheater.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-National_Garden-16&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[17]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Plant production facility&lt;/i&gt; A plant production facility in Anacostia, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, includes greenhouse bays and a support facility for the garden. The &lt;i&gt;U.S. Botanic Garden Production Facility&lt;/i&gt;, covers 85,000&amp;nbsp;square feet (7,900&amp;nbsp;m2) under glass, and is the largest support facility for a botanic garden in the United States. It houses collections currently not on display, including plants recuperating. Seasonal plants are also grown at the facility for use in the Supreme Court, Library of Congress and for replenishing the Capitol grounds. An estimated 100,000 mums, pansies, cabbage, kale and other annuals and perennials per year are grown in the facility. Additionally, foliage plants for the Senate offices and palm trees for Capitol Hill events as well as special seasonal displays such as Easter lilies and poinsettias are all grown on site.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-production-0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;According to staff botanists, there are about 50,000 plants on hand at the production facility at any one time.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-production-0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Current operation&lt;/i&gt; Presently, the United States Botanic Garden is home to almost 10,000 living specimens, some of them over 165 years old.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-garden-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; The national monument was closed for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renovation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;renovations&lt;/a&gt; on September 1, 1997, and reopened to the public on December 11, 2001.

Because of the lifespan of Vessel Ferns, it is highly unlikely that the present fern is the original; however it is believed that the present fern is a direct descendant and genetically identical to the original. * The Ferocious Blue Cycad (&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalartos_horridus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Encephalartos horridus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycad&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cycad&lt;/a&gt; questionably one of the original Wilkes plants. Due to its size and possible age, some believe this plant to have come back with the expedition in 1842; unfortunately, early records are incomplete and inaccurate, so this is left to speculation. * The Queen Sagos &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycas_circinalis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cycas circinalis&lt;/a&gt;, which are cycads, live in the Garden Court.

He had been warned in 1796 that if he chose to plant crops &amp;quot;on the avenue and the Mall&amp;quot;, it was at his own risk as something might be done &amp;quot;almost any time&amp;quot; to make a thoroughfare.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; It is probable that &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Thomas Jefferson&lt;/a&gt; was the first influential person who took an interest in cleaning up the brush that covered the land. By 1810, some rows of Lombardy poplars had been planted, however, the avenue itself &amp;quot;was too much of a morass&amp;quot; to be traversed on horseback.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Botanic Garden of the Columbian Institute&lt;/i&gt; One of the greatest accomplishments of the institution was the creation of a botanic garden in 1821. &amp;quot;By the end of 1823 the swampy tract of land granted by Congress had been drained and leveled, an elliptical pond with an island at its center constructed, and four graveled walks laid out. Trees and shrubs were planted, and the garden was maintained as well as scanty funds would permit until the institute expired in 1837, one year before the termination of its charter.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-botanical-3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; On May 26, 1824, the grounds were extended and in 1825, they were enclosed. &amp;quot;There seems to be no record of what improvements or plantings were made by the Columbian Institute. The institute had expended $1,500 on the grounds for walks and plantings and had asked Congress to be reimbursed, but this request was not granted.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-elliott-6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt; Although the membership roster of the Columbian Institution included many distinguished citizens and several presidents, they were unable to raise money for the greenhouse and lecture hall.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; Meetings were held in a variety of temporary offices, including a committee room in the capitol building that Congress granted use of on December 20, 1828.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-rooms-10&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[11]&lt;/a&gt; Despite all the hardships, the Institute quickly launched an enthusiastic effort to collect plants and seeds.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; In 1826, a committee was appointed to meet with heads of government departments to help solicit &amp;quot;all subjects of natural history that may be deemed interesting&amp;quot; from foreign representatives. The following year, Secretary of the Treasury, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Rush&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Richard Rush&lt;/a&gt; was also involved in the solicitation by circulating a letter to foreign dignitaries.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; In the letter he stated that President &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;John Quincy Adams&lt;/a&gt; was &amp;quot;desirous of causing to be introduced into the United States all such trees and plants from other countries not heretofore known in the United States, as may give promise, under proper cultivation, of flourishing and becoming useful....&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; The publicity was extremely successful. Plants and seeds made their way to the Institute from as far away as China and Brazil. Some came from areas nearby, such as Montgomery County in Maryland. In 1824, a &lt;i&gt;List of Plants in the Botanic Garden of the Columbian Institute&lt;/i&gt; was prepared by William Elliot.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; The pamphlet mentioned more than 458 plants growing at that time.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-elliott-6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt; Sixteen years passed and by 1836, no further improvements had been made on the property. &amp;quot;The tract was a stagnant and malarial swamp and Congress was prevailed upon to make an appropriation of $5,000 for improvements.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-improvements-11&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[12]&lt;/a&gt; The funds were used to drain the site and erect a fountain.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; Financial woes continued to plague the Institute, and there was &amp;quot;never enough money from contributions for proper maintenance of the garden and plant collections.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; The facility ceased to operate in 1837 when the society stopped holding meetings. However it was re-instituted in 1842 when the Wilkes expedition of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ocean&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt; brought back a collection of plants.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Wilkes exploring and surveying expedition&lt;/i&gt; In 1838, Lt. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Wilkes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Charles Wilkes&lt;/a&gt; set out on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Exploring_Expedition&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;United States Exploring Expedition&lt;/a&gt; commissioned by Congress&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumnavigation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;circumnavigate&lt;/a&gt; the globe and explore the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; Between the years 1838–1842, the expedition, consisting of six government ships, traveled 87,000 miles&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-garden-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; and collected a large assortment of horticultural and botanical specimens. These formed the nucleus of the present garden.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The expedition also confirmed that Antarctica was a continent.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-garden-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; The staff included a botanist, W. D. Breckenridge who brought back a large collection of specimens, including seeds and cuttings.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-improvements-11&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[12]&lt;/a&gt; Because the garden was situated in a swamp, early attempts at cultivation were not successful, however, during 1842; a revival was made after the Wilkes Expedition brought many rare plants to Washington from the Fiji, Sandwich and Society Islands, New Zealand and South America. During this trip, Wilkes collected live and dried &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;specimens&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;plants&lt;/a&gt; and was one of the first to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardian_case&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;wardian cases&lt;/a&gt; to maintain live plants on long voyages. Members of the expedition returned with a massive collection of plants previously unknown in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The dried specimens comprised the core of what is now the &lt;b&gt;National Herbarium&lt;/b&gt;, an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbarium&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;herbarium&lt;/a&gt; curated by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Smithsonian Institution's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_Natural_History&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;National Museum of Natural History&lt;/a&gt;. The live Wilkes specimens and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;seeds&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;were transferred successively to frames in 1844 and to the Old Patent Office greenhouse, the first building on the site, where they remained until 1850.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-swamp-5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt; At that time, a botanic garden was built to house the collection in front of the Capitol, where the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflecting_pool&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reflecting pool&lt;/a&gt; is now located. They were moved again in 1934.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-swamp-5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;U.S. Botanic Garden&lt;/i&gt; The very tract of land the Botanical Garden of the Columbian Institute occupied, became the site of the United States Botanic Garden, established in 1850, thirteen years after the demise of the institute. In 1867, Congress provided money for the construction of the first greenhouses. The main conservatory building was erected, 30 feet long with a dome 60 feet high.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; Several historic trees stood on the site including the &lt;i&gt;Crittenden Oak&lt;/i&gt; which marks the spot where &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_J._Crittenden&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;John J. Crittenden&lt;/a&gt; made an address in an effort to avert the Civil War. Also, &lt;i&gt;the Beck-Washington Elm&lt;/i&gt; was a scion of an elm earlier planted by Washington himself. A plane tree which &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaddeus_Stevens&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Thaddeus Stevens&lt;/a&gt; brought from the &lt;i&gt;Vale of Cashmere&lt;/i&gt;, a sycamore planted by Senator &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Voorhees&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Daniel Voorhees&lt;/a&gt; and a Chinese oak from the grave of Confucius, two cedars of Lebanon, and several others that have historic associations.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; The &lt;i&gt;Bartholdl Fountain&lt;/i&gt;, the work of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%c3%a9d%c3%a9ric_Auguste_Bartholdi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi&lt;/a&gt;, the same sculptor who designed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Liberty&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Statue of Liberty&lt;/a&gt; in New York Harbor stood in a central site in the gardens, however, it was placed in storage for several years to make way for the memorial to General Meade, the hero of Gettysburg.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; The garden &amp;quot;was formally placed under the jurisdiction of the Joint Committee on the Library of Congress in 1856 and has been administered through the Office of the Architect of the Capitol since 1934. The Architect of the Capitol has served as Acting Director of the United States Botanic Garden and is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the Garden and for any construction, changes, or improvements made.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-architect-13&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[14]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Talk of expansion and move&lt;/i&gt; A discussion about moving the garden began in Congress in August, 1922. &amp;quot;It appears likely that the public features of the present garden will be transferred from the west side of the Capitol to the north side and that a new botanic garden and arboretum on an adequate scale will be established not far from the Capitol.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The site of the original garden was fewer than 13&amp;nbsp;acres (53,000 m2), in comparison to the famous Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in London, which had 288&amp;nbsp;acres (1.17&amp;nbsp;km2). The garden in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin,_Germany&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Berlin, Germany&lt;/a&gt;, has over 1,325&amp;nbsp;acres (5.36&amp;nbsp;km2) and was established at a cost of over $4,000,000. In comparison, $1,416,748 was spent on the garden in Washington between the years 1842–1922. This included the original appropriation for the Wilkes expedition.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; Senate resolution 165 was passed and a committee was formed to review the acquisition of a new site. Lieut. Col. Clarence O. Sherrill, Corps of Engineers, secretary and executive officer of the fine arts commission, compiled a report on the garden.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; It was felt that the botanic garden must be removed because when Congress established the location of the Grant Memorial in the garden-area, technically, it forced the garden out. &amp;quot;Such was the intention of Congress.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The action was entirely logical. That space was designed by President &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;George Washington&lt;/a&gt; and Maj. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Charles_L'Enfant&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pierre Charles L'Enfant&lt;/a&gt; as an open approach to the Capitol, which is shown on the original plan to the city. &amp;quot;It was proposed at that time that this area should be subject to ornamentation with memorials, foundations, and the like, but not shut off by walls and fences. Locating the Botanic Garden in this area was one of those serious mistakes made in the early part of the century whereby the great plan for the Nation's Capital suffered damage that has continued to this day.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; Sherrill's report pointed out that the goal of Congress was to restore the Mall to its original status as a park connection between the legislative and executive departments. Congress had paid the Pennsylvania Railroad $1,500,000 to remove its tracks from the Mall. &amp;quot;The new National Museum Building, the Agriculture Department buildings, and the gallery for the Freer collections all have been located with reference in the general plan. Slowly, but steadily, changes in conformity with that plan are now being carried out throughout the entire 2½ miles from the Capitol Grounds to the Lincoln Memorial. The removal of the Botanic Garden is essential to the development of the great composition.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;If Congress desires to continue a garden for the purpose of obtaining flowers for its members and for growing shrubs to disseminate throughout the country, both of these purposes can be subserved quite as well by glass houses and gardens in other accessible locations.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; It was also felt that the new location would provide enlargement of the Capitol Grounds on the north which affords an area for gardens of great beauty and distinction &amp;quot;through which will pass all visitors to Washington and a large proportion of those persons who daily go to the Capitol and Library of Congress.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The old location was seen as assessable to only &amp;quot;an insignificant fraction of visitors or residents&amp;quot; and that the removal of the garden from the west side of the Capitol to the north side made the features of the garden more available.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; An exhaustive search was made of several areas available for garden purposes and Mount Hamilton, a privately owned site, was chosen. The tract fronted the Anacostia River and carried a variety of soils in such condition that &amp;quot;very little preparation for the uses of a botanic garden would be needed and very little grading other than that required for roads.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The tract had north, south, east and west slopes and a level area on Hickey Road that would work well for greenhouses and herbaceous gardens, while the other sloped areas would be ideal for shrub and small flowering-tree arboretum uses.

Also, a park entrance to the city from the north will be provided. Additionally, the public features of the &amp;quot;present&amp;quot; Botanic Garden be transferred from the west side of the Capitol to the north side to lands already owned by the Government.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;New location&lt;/i&gt; In 1933, the main building was moved to its present location on the National Mall, just to the southwest of the Capitol, bordered by Maryland Avenue on the north, First Street on the east, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Avenue_(Washington_D.C.)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Independence Avenue&lt;/a&gt; on the south, and Third Street on the west.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-Botanic_Garden-2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; The facility includes a conservatory and 2&amp;nbsp;acres (8,100&amp;nbsp;m2) of outside grounds.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-14&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[15]&lt;/a&gt; Directly across Independence Avenue is Bartholdi Park, an outdoor display area, and an administration building.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-Botanic_Garden-2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-15&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[16]&lt;/a&gt; Located on 3&amp;nbsp;acres (12,000&amp;nbsp;m2) west of the conservatory and opened to the public on October 1, 2006, the National Garden provides living laboratories for environmental, horticultural, and botanical education.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-National_Garden-16&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[17]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-newsite-17&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[18]&lt;/a&gt; The major features of the National Garden are the Rose Garden, the Butterfly Garden, the Lawn Terrace, the First Ladies' Water Garden, the Regional Garden, and an outdoor amphitheater.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-National_Garden-16&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[17]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Plant production facility&lt;/i&gt; A plant production facility in Anacostia, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, includes greenhouse bays and a support facility for the garden. The &lt;i&gt;U.S. Botanic Garden Production Facility&lt;/i&gt;, covers 85,000&amp;nbsp;square feet (7,900&amp;nbsp;m2) under glass, and is the largest support facility for a botanic garden in the United States. It houses collections currently not on display, including plants recuperating. Seasonal plants are also grown at the facility for use in the Supreme Court, Library of Congress and for replenishing the Capitol grounds. An estimated 100,000 mums, pansies, cabbage, kale and other annuals and perennials per year are grown in the facility. Additionally, foliage plants for the Senate offices and palm trees for Capitol Hill events as well as special seasonal displays such as Easter lilies and poinsettias are all grown on site.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-production-0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;According to staff botanists, there are about 50,000 plants on hand at the production facility at any one time.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-production-0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Current operation&lt;/i&gt; Presently, the United States Botanic Garden is home to almost 10,000 living specimens, some of them over 165 years old.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-garden-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; The national monument was closed for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renovation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;renovations&lt;/a&gt; on September 1, 1997, and reopened to the public on December 11, 2001.

Because of the lifespan of Vessel Ferns, it is highly unlikely that the present fern is the original; however it is believed that the present fern is a direct descendant and genetically identical to the original. * The Ferocious Blue Cycad (&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalartos_horridus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Encephalartos horridus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycad&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cycad&lt;/a&gt; questionably one of the original Wilkes plants. Due to its size and possible age, some believe this plant to have come back with the expedition in 1842; unfortunately, early records are incomplete and inaccurate, so this is left to speculation. * The Queen Sagos &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycas_circinalis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cycas circinalis&lt;/a&gt;, which are cycads, live in the Garden Court.

He had been warned in 1796 that if he chose to plant crops &amp;quot;on the avenue and the Mall&amp;quot;, it was at his own risk as something might be done &amp;quot;almost any time&amp;quot; to make a thoroughfare.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; It is probable that &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Thomas Jefferson&lt;/a&gt; was the first influential person who took an interest in cleaning up the brush that covered the land. By 1810, some rows of Lombardy poplars had been planted, however, the avenue itself &amp;quot;was too much of a morass&amp;quot; to be traversed on horseback.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Botanic Garden of the Columbian Institute&lt;/i&gt; One of the greatest accomplishments of the institution was the creation of a botanic garden in 1821. &amp;quot;By the end of 1823 the swampy tract of land granted by Congress had been drained and leveled, an elliptical pond with an island at its center constructed, and four graveled walks laid out. Trees and shrubs were planted, and the garden was maintained as well as scanty funds would permit until the institute expired in 1837, one year before the termination of its charter.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-botanical-3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; On May 26, 1824, the grounds were extended and in 1825, they were enclosed. &amp;quot;There seems to be no record of what improvements or plantings were made by the Columbian Institute. The institute had expended $1,500 on the grounds for walks and plantings and had asked Congress to be reimbursed, but this request was not granted.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-elliott-6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt; Although the membership roster of the Columbian Institution included many distinguished citizens and several presidents, they were unable to raise money for the greenhouse and lecture hall.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; Meetings were held in a variety of temporary offices, including a committee room in the capitol building that Congress granted use of on December 20, 1828.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-rooms-10&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[11]&lt;/a&gt; Despite all the hardships, the Institute quickly launched an enthusiastic effort to collect plants and seeds.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; In 1826, a committee was appointed to meet with heads of government departments to help solicit &amp;quot;all subjects of natural history that may be deemed interesting&amp;quot; from foreign representatives. The following year, Secretary of the Treasury, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Rush&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Richard Rush&lt;/a&gt; was also involved in the solicitation by circulating a letter to foreign dignitaries.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; In the letter he stated that President &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;John Quincy Adams&lt;/a&gt; was &amp;quot;desirous of causing to be introduced into the United States all such trees and plants from other countries not heretofore known in the United States, as may give promise, under proper cultivation, of flourishing and becoming useful....&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; The publicity was extremely successful. Plants and seeds made their way to the Institute from as far away as China and Brazil. Some came from areas nearby, such as Montgomery County in Maryland. In 1824, a &lt;i&gt;List of Plants in the Botanic Garden of the Columbian Institute&lt;/i&gt; was prepared by William Elliot.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; The pamphlet mentioned more than 458 plants growing at that time.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-elliott-6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt; Sixteen years passed and by 1836, no further improvements had been made on the property. &amp;quot;The tract was a stagnant and malarial swamp and Congress was prevailed upon to make an appropriation of $5,000 for improvements.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-improvements-11&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[12]&lt;/a&gt; The funds were used to drain the site and erect a fountain.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; Financial woes continued to plague the Institute, and there was &amp;quot;never enough money from contributions for proper maintenance of the garden and plant collections.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; The facility ceased to operate in 1837 when the society stopped holding meetings. However it was re-instituted in 1842 when the Wilkes expedition of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ocean&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt; brought back a collection of plants.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Wilkes exploring and surveying expedition&lt;/i&gt; In 1838, Lt. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Wilkes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Charles Wilkes&lt;/a&gt; set out on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Exploring_Expedition&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;United States Exploring Expedition&lt;/a&gt; commissioned by Congress&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumnavigation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;circumnavigate&lt;/a&gt; the globe and explore the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; Between the years 1838–1842, the expedition, consisting of six government ships, traveled 87,000 miles&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-garden-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; and collected a large assortment of horticultural and botanical specimens. These formed the nucleus of the present garden.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The expedition also confirmed that Antarctica was a continent.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-garden-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; The staff included a botanist, W.

Breckenridge who brought back a large collection of specimens, including seeds and cuttings.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-improvements-11&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[12]&lt;/a&gt; Because the garden was situated in a swamp, early attempts at cultivation were not successful, however, during 1842; a revival was made after the Wilkes Expedition brought many rare plants to Washington from the Fiji, Sandwich and Society Islands, New Zealand and South America. During this trip, Wilkes collected live and dried &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;specimens&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;plants&lt;/a&gt; and was one of the first to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardian_case&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;wardian cases&lt;/a&gt; to maintain live plants on long voyages. Members of the expedition returned with a massive collection of plants previously unknown in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The dried specimens comprised the core of what is now the &lt;b&gt;National Herbarium&lt;/b&gt;, an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbarium&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;herbarium&lt;/a&gt; curated by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Smithsonian Institution's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_Natural_History&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;National Museum of Natural History&lt;/a&gt;. The live Wilkes specimens and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;seeds&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;were transferred successively to frames in 1844 and to the Old Patent Office greenhouse, the first building on the site, where they remained until 1850.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-swamp-5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt; At that time, a botanic garden was built to house the collection in front of the Capitol, where the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflecting_pool&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reflecting pool&lt;/a&gt; is now located. They were moved again in 1934.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-swamp-5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;U.S. Botanic Garden&lt;/i&gt; The very tract of land the Botanical Garden of the Columbian Institute occupied, became the site of the United States Botanic Garden, established in 1850, thirteen years after the demise of the institute. In 1867, Congress provided money for the construction of the first greenhouses. The main conservatory building was erected, 30 feet long with a dome 60 feet high.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; Several historic trees stood on the site including the &lt;i&gt;Crittenden Oak&lt;/i&gt; which marks the spot where &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_J._Crittenden&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;John J. Crittenden&lt;/a&gt; made an address in an effort to avert the Civil War. Also, &lt;i&gt;the Beck-Washington Elm&lt;/i&gt; was a scion of an elm earlier planted by Washington himself. A plane tree which &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaddeus_Stevens&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Thaddeus Stevens&lt;/a&gt; brought from the &lt;i&gt;Vale of Cashmere&lt;/i&gt;, a sycamore planted by Senator &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Voorhees&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Daniel Voorhees&lt;/a&gt; and a Chinese oak from the grave of Confucius, two cedars of Lebanon, and several others that have historic associations.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; The &lt;i&gt;Bartholdl Fountain&lt;/i&gt;, the work of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%c3%a9d%c3%a9ric_Auguste_Bartholdi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi&lt;/a&gt;, the same sculptor who designed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Liberty&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Statue of Liberty&lt;/a&gt; in New York Harbor stood in a central site in the gardens, however, it was placed in storage for several years to make way for the memorial to General Meade, the hero of Gettysburg.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; The garden &amp;quot;was formally placed under the jurisdiction of the Joint Committee on the Library of Congress in 1856 and has been administered through the Office of the Architect of the Capitol since 1934. The Architect of the Capitol has served as Acting Director of the United States Botanic Garden and is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the Garden and for any construction, changes, or improvements made.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-architect-13&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[14]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Talk of expansion and move&lt;/i&gt; A discussion about moving the garden began in Congress in August, 1922. &amp;quot;It appears likely that the public features of the present garden will be transferred from the west side of the Capitol to the north side and that a new botanic garden and arboretum on an adequate scale will be established not far from the Capitol.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The site of the original garden was fewer than 13&amp;nbsp;acres (53,000 m2), in comparison to the famous Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in London, which had 288&amp;nbsp;acres (1.17&amp;nbsp;km2). The garden in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin,_Germany&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Berlin, Germany&lt;/a&gt;, has over 1,325&amp;nbsp;acres (5.36&amp;nbsp;km2) and was established at a cost of over $4,000,000. In comparison, $1,416,748 was spent on the garden in Washington between the years 1842–1922. This included the original appropriation for the Wilkes expedition.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; Senate resolution 165 was passed and a committee was formed to review the acquisition of a new site. Lieut. Col. Clarence O. Sherrill, Corps of Engineers, secretary and executive officer of the fine arts commission, compiled a report on the garden.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; It was felt that the botanic garden must be removed because when Congress established the location of the Grant Memorial in the garden-area, technically, it forced the garden out. &amp;quot;Such was the intention of Congress.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The action was entirely logical. That space was designed by President &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;George Washington&lt;/a&gt; and Maj. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Charles_L'Enfant&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pierre Charles L'Enfant&lt;/a&gt; as an open approach to the Capitol, which is shown on the original plan to the city. &amp;quot;It was proposed at that time that this area should be subject to ornamentation with memorials, foundations, and the like, but not shut off by walls and fences. Locating the Botanic Garden in this area was one of those serious mistakes made in the early part of the century whereby the great plan for the Nation's Capital suffered damage that has continued to this day.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; Sherrill's report pointed out that the goal of Congress was to restore the Mall to its original status as a park connection between the legislative and executive departments. Congress had paid the Pennsylvania Railroad $1,500,000 to remove its tracks from the Mall. &amp;quot;The new National Museum Building, the Agriculture Department buildings, and the gallery for the Freer collections all have been located with reference in the general plan. Slowly, but steadily, changes in conformity with that plan are now being carried out throughout the entire 2½ miles from the Capitol Grounds to the Lincoln Memorial. The removal of the Botanic Garden is essential to the development of the great composition.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;If Congress desires to continue a garden for the purpose of obtaining flowers for its members and for growing shrubs to disseminate throughout the country, both of these purposes can be subserved quite as well by glass houses and gardens in other accessible locations.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; It was also felt that the new location would provide enlargement of the Capitol Grounds on the north which affords an area for gardens of great beauty and distinction &amp;quot;through which will pass all visitors to Washington and a large proportion of those persons who daily go to the Capitol and Library of Congress.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The old location was seen as assessable to only &amp;quot;an insignificant fraction of visitors or residents&amp;quot; and that the removal of the garden from the west side of the Capitol to the north side made the features of the garden more available.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; An exhaustive search was made of several areas available for garden purposes and Mount Hamilton, a privately owned site, was chosen. The tract fronted the Anacostia River and carried a variety of soils in such condition that &amp;quot;very little preparation for the uses of a botanic garden would be needed and very little grading other than that required for roads.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The tract had north, south, east and west slopes and a level area on Hickey Road that would work well for greenhouses and herbaceous gardens, while the other sloped areas would be ideal for shrub and small flowering-tree arboretum uses. The entire area contained about 400&amp;nbsp;acres (1.6&amp;nbsp;km2) and would &amp;quot;afford an entrance to Washington of unequaled beauty.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; In the future, it was felt that the garden could be expanded by &amp;quot;that portion of the park between the Pennsylvania Railroad and Benning Bridge contains about 563 acres, lowland and water, thus furnishing ample opportunity for expansion on land not subject to overflow for lowland and fresh-water exhibits.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The Commission of Fine Art made recommendation that the Mount Hamilton tract be acquired for a national botanic garden and arboretum; by purchasing 400&amp;nbsp;acres (1.6&amp;nbsp;km2) of land, at least 800&amp;nbsp;acres (3.2&amp;nbsp;km2) of Government-owned lands will be made available. Also, a park entrance to the city from the north will be provided. Additionally, the public features of the &amp;quot;present&amp;quot; Botanic Garden be transferred from the west side of the Capitol to the north side to lands already owned by the Government.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;New location&lt;/i&gt; In 1933, the main building was moved to its present location on the National Mall, just to the southwest of the Capitol, bordered by Maryland Avenue on the north, First Street on the east, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Avenue_(Washington_D.C.)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Independence Avenue&lt;/a&gt; on the south, and Third Street on the west.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-Botanic_Garden-2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; The facility includes a conservatory and 2&amp;nbsp;acres (8,100&amp;nbsp;m2) of outside grounds.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-14&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[15]&lt;/a&gt; Directly across Independence Avenue is Bartholdi Park, an outdoor display area, and an administration building.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-Botanic_Garden-2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-15&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[16]&lt;/a&gt; Located on 3&amp;nbsp;acres (12,000&amp;nbsp;m2) west of the conservatory and opened to the public on October 1, 2006, the National Garden provides living laboratories for environmental, horticultural, and botanical education.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-National_Garden-16&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[17]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-newsite-17&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[18]&lt;/a&gt; The major features of the National Garden are the Rose Garden, the Butterfly Garden, the Lawn Terrace, the First Ladies' Water Garden, the Regional Garden, and an outdoor amphitheater.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-National_Garden-16&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[17]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Plant production facility&lt;/i&gt; A plant production facility in Anacostia, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, includes greenhouse bays and a support facility for the garden. The &lt;i&gt;U.S. Botanic Garden Production Facility&lt;/i&gt;, covers 85,000&amp;nbsp;square feet (7,900&amp;nbsp;m2) under glass, and is the largest support facility for a botanic garden in the United States. It houses collections currently not on display, including plants recuperating. Seasonal plants are also grown at the facility for use in the Supreme Court, Library of Congress and for replenishing the Capitol grounds. An estimated 100,000 mums, pansies, cabbage, kale and other annuals and perennials per year are grown in the facility. Additionally, foliage plants for the Senate offices and palm trees for Capitol Hill events as well as special seasonal displays such as Easter lilies and poinsettias are all grown on site.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-production-0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;According to staff botanists, there are about 50,000 plants on hand at the production facility at any one time.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-production-0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Current operation&lt;/i&gt; Presently, the United States Botanic Garden is home to almost 10,000 living specimens, some of them over 165 years old.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-garden-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; The national monument was closed for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renovation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;renovations&lt;/a&gt; on September 1, 1997, and reopened to the public on December 11, 2001.

It is named for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartholdi_Fountain&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Bartholdi Fountain&lt;/a&gt; in the garden's center designed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%c3%a9d%c3%a9ric_Bartholdi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Frédéric Bartholdi&lt;/a&gt;. One of the goals of this garden is to provide inspiration and ideas for home gardeners who visit it. It displays a variety of small structured and non-structured gardens, and infuses color, shape, and planting themes. One section of the garden is certified as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Wildlife_Federation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;National Wildlife Federation&lt;/a&gt; Backyard Wildlife Habitat. The Park also houses the administrative building for the United States Botanic Garden. The Production Facility in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest,_Washington,_D.C.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;southwest D.C.&lt;/a&gt; is used for growing and storing plants for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_propagation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;propagation&lt;/a&gt;, for collection maintenance, or for display in upcoming annual shows. The USBG participates in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CITES&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CITES&lt;/a&gt; (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species), which means that it cares for plants seized by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Customs_and_Border_Protection&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Customs&lt;/a&gt;.

Because of the lifespan of Vessel Ferns, it is highly unlikely that the present fern is the original; however it is believed that the present fern is a direct descendant and genetically identical to the original. * The Ferocious Blue Cycad (&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalartos_horridus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Encephalartos horridus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycad&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cycad&lt;/a&gt; questionably one of the original Wilkes plants. Due to its size and possible age, some believe this plant to have come back with the expedition in 1842; unfortunately, early records are incomplete and inaccurate, so this is left to speculation. * The Queen Sagos &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycas_circinalis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cycas circinalis&lt;/a&gt;, which are cycads, live in the Garden Court.

He had been warned in 1796 that if he chose to plant crops &amp;quot;on the avenue and the Mall&amp;quot;, it was at his own risk as something might be done &amp;quot;almost any time&amp;quot; to make a thoroughfare.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; It is probable that &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Thomas Jefferson&lt;/a&gt; was the first influential person who took an interest in cleaning up the brush that covered the land. By 1810, some rows of Lombardy poplars had been planted, however, the avenue itself &amp;quot;was too much of a morass&amp;quot; to be traversed on horseback.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Botanic Garden of the Columbian Institute&lt;/i&gt; One of the greatest accomplishments of the institution was the creation of a botanic garden in 1821. &amp;quot;By the end of 1823 the swampy tract of land granted by Congress had been drained and leveled, an elliptical pond with an island at its center constructed, and four graveled walks laid out. Trees and shrubs were planted, and the garden was maintained as well as scanty funds would permit until the institute expired in 1837, one year before the termination of its charter.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-botanical-3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; On May 26, 1824, the grounds were extended and in 1825, they were enclosed. &amp;quot;There seems to be no record of what improvements or plantings were made by the Columbian Institute. The institute had expended $1,500 on the grounds for walks and plantings and had asked Congress to be reimbursed, but this request was not granted.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-elliott-6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt; Although the membership roster of the Columbian Institution included many distinguished citizens and several presidents, they were unable to raise money for the greenhouse and lecture hall.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; Meetings were held in a variety of temporary offices, including a committee room in the capitol building that Congress granted use of on December 20, 1828.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-rooms-10&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[11]&lt;/a&gt; Despite all the hardships, the Institute quickly launched an enthusiastic effort to collect plants and seeds.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; In 1826, a committee was appointed to meet with heads of government departments to help solicit &amp;quot;all subjects of natural history that may be deemed interesting&amp;quot; from foreign representatives. The following year, Secretary of the Treasury, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Rush&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Richard Rush&lt;/a&gt; was also involved in the solicitation by circulating a letter to foreign dignitaries.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; In the letter he stated that President &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;John Quincy Adams&lt;/a&gt; was &amp;quot;desirous of causing to be introduced into the United States all such trees and plants from other countries not heretofore known in the United States, as may give promise, under proper cultivation, of flourishing and becoming useful....&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; The publicity was extremely successful. Plants and seeds made their way to the Institute from as far away as China and Brazil. Some came from areas nearby, such as Montgomery County in Maryland. In 1824, a &lt;i&gt;List of Plants in the Botanic Garden of the Columbian Institute&lt;/i&gt; was prepared by William Elliot.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; The pamphlet mentioned more than 458 plants growing at that time.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-elliott-6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt; Sixteen years passed and by 1836, no further improvements had been made on the property. &amp;quot;The tract was a stagnant and malarial swamp and Congress was prevailed upon to make an appropriation of $5,000 for improvements.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-improvements-11&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[12]&lt;/a&gt; The funds were used to drain the site and erect a fountain.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; Financial woes continued to plague the Institute, and there was &amp;quot;never enough money from contributions for proper maintenance of the garden and plant collections.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; The facility ceased to operate in 1837 when the society stopped holding meetings. However it was re-instituted in 1842 when the Wilkes expedition of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ocean&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt; brought back a collection of plants.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Wilkes exploring and surveying expedition&lt;/i&gt; In 1838, Lt. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Wilkes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Charles Wilkes&lt;/a&gt; set out on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Exploring_Expedition&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;United States Exploring Expedition&lt;/a&gt; commissioned by Congress&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumnavigation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;circumnavigate&lt;/a&gt; the globe and explore the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; Between the years 1838–1842, the expedition, consisting of six government ships, traveled 87,000 miles&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-garden-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; and collected a large assortment of horticultural and botanical specimens.

During this trip, Wilkes collected live and dried &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;specimens&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;plants&lt;/a&gt; and was one of the first to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardian_case&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;wardian cases&lt;/a&gt; to maintain live plants on long voyages.

In 1867, Congress provided money for the construction of the first greenhouses. The main conservatory building was erected, 30 feet long with a dome 60 feet high.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; Several historic trees stood on the site including the &lt;i&gt;Crittenden Oak&lt;/i&gt; which marks the spot where &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_J._Crittenden&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;John J.

The Architect of the Capitol has served as Acting Director of the United States Botanic Garden and is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the Garden and for any construction, changes, or improvements made.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-architect-13&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[14]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Talk of expansion and move&lt;/i&gt; A discussion about moving the garden began in Congress in August, 1922. &amp;quot;It appears likely that the public features of the present garden will be transferred from the west side of the Capitol to the north side and that a new botanic garden and arboretum on an adequate scale will be established not far from the Capitol.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The site of the original garden was fewer than 13&amp;nbsp;acres (53,000 m2), in comparison to the famous Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in London, which had 288&amp;nbsp;acres (1.17&amp;nbsp;km2). The garden in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin,_Germany&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Berlin, Germany&lt;/a&gt;, has over 1,325&amp;nbsp;acres (5.36&amp;nbsp;km2) and was established at a cost of over $4,000,000. In comparison, $1,416,748 was spent on the garden in Washington between the years 1842–1922. This included the original appropriation for the Wilkes expedition.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; Senate resolution 165 was passed and a committee was formed to review the acquisition of a new site. Lieut. Col. Clarence O. Sherrill, Corps of Engineers, secretary and executive officer of the fine arts commission, compiled a report on the garden.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; It was felt that the botanic garden must be removed because when Congress established the location of the Grant Memorial in the garden-area, technically, it forced the garden out. &amp;quot;Such was the intention of Congress.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The action was entirely logical. That space was designed by President &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;George Washington&lt;/a&gt; and Maj. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Charles_L'Enfant&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pierre Charles L'Enfant&lt;/a&gt; as an open approach to the Capitol, which is shown on the original plan to the city. &amp;quot;It was proposed at that time that this area should be subject to ornamentation with memorials, foundations, and the like, but not shut off by walls and fences. Locating the Botanic Garden in this area was one of those serious mistakes made in the early part of the century whereby the great plan for the Nation's Capital suffered damage that has continued to this day.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; Sherrill's report pointed out that the goal of Congress was to restore the Mall to its original status as a park connection between the legislative and executive departments. Congress had paid the Pennsylvania Railroad $1,500,000 to remove its tracks from the Mall. &amp;quot;The new National Museum Building, the Agriculture Department buildings, and the gallery for the Freer collections all have been located with reference in the general plan. Slowly, but steadily, changes in conformity with that plan are now being carried out throughout the entire 2½ miles from the Capitol Grounds to the Lincoln Memorial. The removal of the Botanic Garden is essential to the development of the great composition.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;If Congress desires to continue a garden for the purpose of obtaining flowers for its members and for growing shrubs to disseminate throughout the country, both of these purposes can be subserved quite as well by glass houses and gardens in other accessible locations.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; It was also felt that the new location would provide enlargement of the Capitol Grounds on the north which affords an area for gardens of great beauty and distinction &amp;quot;through which will pass all visitors to Washington and a large proportion of those persons who daily go to the Capitol and Library of Congress.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The old location was seen as assessable to only &amp;quot;an insignificant fraction of visitors or residents&amp;quot; and that the removal of the garden from the west side of the Capitol to the north side made the features of the garden more available.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; An exhaustive search was made of several areas available for garden purposes and Mount Hamilton, a privately owned site, was chosen. The tract fronted the Anacostia River and carried a variety of soils in such condition that &amp;quot;very little preparation for the uses of a botanic garden would be needed and very little grading other than that required for roads.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The tract had north, south, east and west slopes and a level area on Hickey Road that would work well for greenhouses and herbaceous gardens, while the other sloped areas would be ideal for shrub and small flowering-tree arboretum uses. The entire area contained about 400&amp;nbsp;acres (1.6&amp;nbsp;km2) and would &amp;quot;afford an entrance to Washington of unequaled beauty.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; In the future, it was felt that the garden could be expanded by &amp;quot;that portion of the park between the Pennsylvania Railroad and Benning Bridge contains about 563 acres, lowland and water, thus furnishing ample opportunity for expansion on land not subject to overflow for lowland and fresh-water exhibits.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The Commission of Fine Art made recommendation that the Mount Hamilton tract be acquired for a national botanic garden and arboretum; by purchasing 400&amp;nbsp;acres (1.6&amp;nbsp;km2) of land, at least 800&amp;nbsp;acres (3.2&amp;nbsp;km2) of Government-owned lands will be made available. Also, a park entrance to the city from the north will be provided. Additionally, the public features of the &amp;quot;present&amp;quot; Botanic Garden be transferred from the west side of the Capitol to the north side to lands already owned by the Government.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;New location&lt;/i&gt; In 1933, the main building was moved to its present location on the National Mall, just to the southwest of the Capitol, bordered by Maryland Avenue on the north, First Street on the east, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Avenue_(Washington_D.C.)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Independence Avenue&lt;/a&gt; on the south, and Third Street on the west.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-Botanic_Garden-2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; The facility includes a conservatory and 2&amp;nbsp;acres (8,100&amp;nbsp;m2) of outside grounds.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-14&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[15]&lt;/a&gt; Directly across Independence Avenue is Bartholdi Park, an outdoor display area, and an administration building.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-Botanic_Garden-2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-15&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[16]&lt;/a&gt; Located on 3&amp;nbsp;acres (12,000&amp;nbsp;m2) west of the conservatory and opened to the public on October 1, 2006, the National Garden provides living laboratories for environmental, horticultural, and botanical education.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-National_Garden-16&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[17]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-newsite-17&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[18]&lt;/a&gt; The major features of the National Garden are the Rose Garden, the Butterfly Garden, the Lawn Terrace, the First Ladies' Water Garden, the Regional Garden, and an outdoor amphitheater.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-National_Garden-16&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[17]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Plant production facility&lt;/i&gt; A plant production facility in Anacostia, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, includes greenhouse bays and a support facility for the garden. The &lt;i&gt;U.S. Botanic Garden Production Facility&lt;/i&gt;, covers 85,000&amp;nbsp;square feet (7,900&amp;nbsp;m2) under glass, and is the largest support facility for a botanic garden in the United States. It houses collections currently not on display, including plants recuperating. Seasonal plants are also grown at the facility for use in the Supreme Court, Library of Congress and for replenishing the Capitol grounds. An estimated 100,000 mums, pansies, cabbage, kale and other annuals and perennials per year are grown in the facility. Additionally, foliage plants for the Senate offices and palm trees for Capitol Hill events as well as special seasonal displays such as Easter lilies and poinsettias are all grown on site.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-production-0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;According to staff botanists, there are about 50,000 plants on hand at the production facility at any one time.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-production-0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Current operation&lt;/i&gt; Presently, the United States Botanic Garden is home to almost 10,000 living specimens, some of them over 165 years old.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-garden-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; The national monument was closed for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renovation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;renovations&lt;/a&gt; on September 1, 1997, and reopened to the public on December 11, 2001.

He had been warned in 1796 that if he chose to plant crops &amp;quot;on the avenue and the Mall&amp;quot;, it was at his own risk as something might be done &amp;quot;almost any time&amp;quot; to make a thoroughfare.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; It is probable that &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Thomas Jefferson&lt;/a&gt; was the first influential person who took an interest in cleaning up the brush that covered the land. By 1810, some rows of Lombardy poplars had been planted, however, the avenue itself &amp;quot;was too much of a morass&amp;quot; to be traversed on horseback.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Botanic Garden of the Columbian Institute&lt;/i&gt; One of the greatest accomplishments of the institution was the creation of a botanic garden in 1821. &amp;quot;By the end of 1823 the swampy tract of land granted by Congress had been drained and leveled, an elliptical pond with an island at its center constructed, and four graveled walks laid out. Trees and shrubs were planted, and the garden was maintained as well as scanty funds would permit until the institute expired in 1837, one year before the termination of its charter.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-botanical-3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; On May 26, 1824, the grounds were extended and in 1825, they were enclosed. &amp;quot;There seems to be no record of what improvements or plantings were made by the Columbian Institute. The institute had expended $1,500 on the grounds for walks and plantings and had asked Congress to be reimbursed, but this request was not granted.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-elliott-6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt; Although the membership roster of the Columbian Institution included many distinguished citizens and several presidents, they were unable to raise money for the greenhouse and lecture hall.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; Meetings were held in a variety of temporary offices, including a committee room in the capitol building that Congress granted use of on December 20, 1828.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-rooms-10&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[11]&lt;/a&gt; Despite all the hardships, the Institute quickly launched an enthusiastic effort to collect plants and seeds.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; In 1826, a committee was appointed to meet with heads of government departments to help solicit &amp;quot;all subjects of natural history that may be deemed interesting&amp;quot; from foreign representatives. The following year, Secretary of the Treasury, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Rush&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Richard Rush&lt;/a&gt; was also involved in the solicitation by circulating a letter to foreign dignitaries.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; In the letter he stated that President &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;John Quincy Adams&lt;/a&gt; was &amp;quot;desirous of causing to be introduced into the United States all such trees and plants from other countries not heretofore known in the United States, as may give promise, under proper cultivation, of flourishing and becoming useful....&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; The publicity was extremely successful. Plants and seeds made their way to the Institute from as far away as China and Brazil. Some came from areas nearby, such as Montgomery County in Maryland. In 1824, a &lt;i&gt;List of Plants in the Botanic Garden of the Columbian Institute&lt;/i&gt; was prepared by William Elliot.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; The pamphlet mentioned more than 458 plants growing at that time.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-elliott-6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt; Sixteen years passed and by 1836, no further improvements had been made on the property. &amp;quot;The tract was a stagnant and malarial swamp and Congress was prevailed upon to make an appropriation of $5,000 for improvements.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-improvements-11&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[12]&lt;/a&gt; The funds were used to drain the site and erect a fountain.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; Financial woes continued to plague the Institute, and there was &amp;quot;never enough money from contributions for proper maintenance of the garden and plant collections.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; The facility ceased to operate in 1837 when the society stopped holding meetings. However it was re-instituted in 1842 when the Wilkes expedition of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ocean&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt; brought back a collection of plants.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Wilkes exploring and surveying expedition&lt;/i&gt; In 1838, Lt. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Wilkes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Charles Wilkes&lt;/a&gt; set out on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Exploring_Expedition&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;United States Exploring Expedition&lt;/a&gt; commissioned by Congress&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumnavigation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;circumnavigate&lt;/a&gt; the globe and explore the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; Between the years 1838–1842, the expedition, consisting of six government ships, traveled 87,000 miles&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-garden-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; and collected a large assortment of horticultural and botanical specimens. These formed the nucleus of the present garden.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The expedition also confirmed that Antarctica was a continent.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-garden-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; The staff included a botanist, W. D. Breckenridge who brought back a large collection of specimens, including seeds and cuttings.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-improvements-11&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[12]&lt;/a&gt; Because the garden was situated in a swamp, early attempts at cultivation were not successful, however, during 1842; a revival was made after the Wilkes Expedition brought many rare plants to Washington from the Fiji, Sandwich and Society Islands, New Zealand and South America. During this trip, Wilkes collected live and dried &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;specimens&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;plants&lt;/a&gt; and was one of the first to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardian_case&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;wardian cases&lt;/a&gt; to maintain live plants on long voyages. Members of the expedition returned with a massive collection of plants previously unknown in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The dried specimens comprised the core of what is now the &lt;b&gt;National Herbarium&lt;/b&gt;, an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbarium&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;herbarium&lt;/a&gt; curated by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Smithsonian Institution's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_Natural_History&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;National Museum of Natural History&lt;/a&gt;. The live Wilkes specimens and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;seeds&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;were transferred successively to frames in 1844 and to the Old Patent Office greenhouse, the first building on the site, where they remained until 1850.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-swamp-5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt; At that time, a botanic garden was built to house the collection in front of the Capitol, where the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflecting_pool&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reflecting pool&lt;/a&gt; is now located. They were moved again in 1934.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-swamp-5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;U.S. Botanic Garden&lt;/i&gt; The very tract of land the Botanical Garden of the Columbian Institute occupied, became the site of the United States Botanic Garden, established in 1850, thirteen years after the demise of the institute. In 1867, Congress provided money for the construction of the first greenhouses. The main conservatory building was erected, 30 feet long with a dome 60 feet high.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; Several historic trees stood on the site including the &lt;i&gt;Crittenden Oak&lt;/i&gt; which marks the spot where &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_J._Crittenden&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;John J. Crittenden&lt;/a&gt; made an address in an effort to avert the Civil War. Also, &lt;i&gt;the Beck-Washington Elm&lt;/i&gt; was a scion of an elm earlier planted by Washington himself. A plane tree which &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaddeus_Stevens&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Thaddeus Stevens&lt;/a&gt; brought from the &lt;i&gt;Vale of Cashmere&lt;/i&gt;, a sycamore planted by Senator &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Voorhees&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Daniel Voorhees&lt;/a&gt; and a Chinese oak from the grave of Confucius, two cedars of Lebanon, and several others that have historic associations.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; The &lt;i&gt;Bartholdl Fountain&lt;/i&gt;, the work of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%c3%a9d%c3%a9ric_Auguste_Bartholdi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi&lt;/a&gt;, the same sculptor who designed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Liberty&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Statue of Liberty&lt;/a&gt; in New York Harbor stood in a central site in the gardens, however, it was placed in storage for several years to make way for the memorial to General Meade, the hero of Gettysburg.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; The garden &amp;quot;was formally placed under the jurisdiction of the Joint Committee on the Library of Congress in 1856 and has been administered through the Office of the Architect of the Capitol since 1934. The Architect of the Capitol has served as Acting Director of the United States Botanic Garden and is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the Garden and for any construction, changes, or improvements made.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-architect-13&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[14]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Talk of expansion and move&lt;/i&gt; A discussion about moving the garden began in Congress in August, 1922. &amp;quot;It appears likely that the public features of the present garden will be transferred from the west side of the Capitol to the north side and that a new botanic garden and arboretum on an adequate scale will be established not far from the Capitol.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The site of the original garden was fewer than 13&amp;nbsp;acres (53,000 m2), in comparison to the famous Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in London, which had 288&amp;nbsp;acres (1.17&amp;nbsp;km2). The garden in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin,_Germany&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Berlin, Germany&lt;/a&gt;, has over 1,325&amp;nbsp;acres (5.36&amp;nbsp;km2) and was established at a cost of over $4,000,000. In comparison, $1,416,748 was spent on the garden in Washington between the years 1842–1922. This included the original appropriation for the Wilkes expedition.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; Senate resolution 165 was passed and a committee was formed to review the acquisition of a new site. Lieut. Col. Clarence O. Sherrill, Corps of Engineers, secretary and executive officer of the fine arts commission, compiled a report on the garden.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; It was felt that the botanic garden must be removed because when Congress established the location of the Grant Memorial in the garden-area, technically, it forced the garden out. &amp;quot;Such was the intention of Congress.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The action was entirely logical. That space was designed by President &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;George Washington&lt;/a&gt; and Maj. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Charles_L'Enfant&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pierre Charles L'Enfant&lt;/a&gt; as an open approach to the Capitol, which is shown on the original plan to the city. &amp;quot;It was proposed at that time that this area should be subject to ornamentation with memorials, foundations, and the like, but not shut off by walls and fences. Locating the Botanic Garden in this area was one of those serious mistakes made in the early part of the century whereby the great plan for the Nation's Capital suffered damage that has continued to this day.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; Sherrill's report pointed out that the goal of Congress was to restore the Mall to its original status as a park connection between the legislative and executive departments. Congress had paid the Pennsylvania Railroad $1,500,000 to remove its tracks from the Mall. &amp;quot;The new National Museum Building, the Agriculture Department buildings, and the gallery for the Freer collections all have been located with reference in the general plan. Slowly, but steadily, changes in conformity with that plan are now being carried out throughout the entire 2½ miles from the Capitol Grounds to the Lincoln Memorial. The removal of the Botanic Garden is essential to the development of the great composition.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;If Congress desires to continue a garden for the purpose of obtaining flowers for its members and for growing shrubs to disseminate throughout the country, both of these purposes can be subserved quite as well by glass houses and gardens in other accessible locations.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; It was also felt that the new location would provide enlargement of the Capitol Grounds on the north which affords an area for gardens of great beauty and distinction &amp;quot;through which will pass all visitors to Washington and a large proportion of those persons who daily go to the Capitol and Library of Congress.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The old location was seen as assessable to only &amp;quot;an insignificant fraction of visitors or residents&amp;quot; and that the removal of the garden from the west side of the Capitol to the north side made the features of the garden more available.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; An exhaustive search was made of several areas available for garden purposes and Mount Hamilton, a privately owned site, was chosen. The tract fronted the Anacostia River and carried a variety of soils in such condition that &amp;quot;very little preparation for the uses of a botanic garden would be needed and very little grading other than that required for roads.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The tract had north, south, east and west slopes and a level area on Hickey Road that would work well for greenhouses and herbaceous gardens, while the other sloped areas would be ideal for shrub and small flowering-tree arboretum uses. The entire area contained about 400&amp;nbsp;acres (1.6&amp;nbsp;km2) and would &amp;quot;afford an entrance to Washington of unequaled beauty.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; In the future, it was felt that the garden could be expanded by &amp;quot;that portion of the park between the Pennsylvania Railroad and Benning Bridge contains about 563 acres, lowland and water, thus furnishing ample opportunity for expansion on land not subject to overflow for lowland and fresh-water exhibits.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The Commission of Fine Art made recommendation that the Mount Hamilton tract be acquired for a national botanic garden and arboretum; by purchasing 400&amp;nbsp;acres (1.6&amp;nbsp;km2) of land, at least 800&amp;nbsp;acres (3.2&amp;nbsp;km2) of Government-owned lands will be made available. Also, a park entrance to the city from the north will be provided. Additionally, the public features of the &amp;quot;present&amp;quot; Botanic Garden be transferred from the west side of the Capitol to the north side to lands already owned by the Government.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;New location&lt;/i&gt; In 1933, the main building was moved to its present location on the National Mall, just to the southwest of the Capitol, bordered by Maryland Avenue on the north, First Street on the east, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Avenue_(Washington_D.C.)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Independence Avenue&lt;/a&gt; on the south, and Third Street on the west.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-Botanic_Garden-2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; The facility includes a conservatory and 2&amp;nbsp;acres (8,100&amp;nbsp;m2) of outside grounds.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-14&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[15]&lt;/a&gt; Directly across Independence Avenue is Bartholdi Park, an outdoor display area, and an administration building.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-Botanic_Garden-2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-15&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[16]&lt;/a&gt; Located on 3&amp;nbsp;acres (12,000&amp;nbsp;m2) west of the conservatory and opened to the public on October 1, 2006, the National Garden provides living laboratories for environmental, horticultural, and botanical education.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-National_Garden-16&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[17]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-newsite-17&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[18]&lt;/a&gt; The major features of the National Garden are the Rose Garden, the Butterfly Garden, the Lawn Terrace, the First Ladies' Water Garden, the Regional Garden, and an outdoor amphitheater.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-National_Garden-16&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[17]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Plant production facility&lt;/i&gt; A plant production facility in Anacostia, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, includes greenhouse bays and a support facility for the garden. The &lt;i&gt;U.S. Botanic Garden Production Facility&lt;/i&gt;, covers 85,000&amp;nbsp;square feet (7,900&amp;nbsp;m2) under glass, and is the largest support facility for a botanic garden in the United States. It houses collections currently not on display, including plants recuperating. Seasonal plants are also grown at the facility for use in the Supreme Court, Library of Congress and for replenishing the Capitol grounds. An estimated 100,000 mums, pansies, cabbage, kale and other annuals and perennials per year are grown in the facility. Additionally, foliage plants for the Senate offices and palm trees for Capitol Hill events as well as special seasonal displays such as Easter lilies and poinsettias are all grown on site.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-production-0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;According to staff botanists, there are about 50,000 plants on hand at the production facility at any one time.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-production-0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Current operation&lt;/i&gt; Presently, the United States Botanic Garden is home to almost 10,000 living specimens, some of them over 165 years old.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-garden-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; The national monument was closed for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renovation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;renovations&lt;/a&gt; on September 1, 1997, and reopened to the public on December 11, 2001.

Because of the lifespan of Vessel Ferns, it is highly unlikely that the present fern is the original; however it is believed that the present fern is a direct descendant and genetically identical to the original. * The Ferocious Blue Cycad (&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalartos_horridus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Encephalartos horridus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycad&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cycad&lt;/a&gt; questionably one of the original Wilkes plants. Due to its size and possible age, some believe this plant to have come back with the expedition in 1842; unfortunately, early records are incomplete and inaccurate, so this is left to speculation. * The Queen Sagos &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycas_circinalis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cycas circinalis&lt;/a&gt;, which are cycads, live in the Garden Court.

He had been warned in 1796 that if he chose to plant crops &amp;quot;on the avenue and the Mall&amp;quot;, it was at his own risk as something might be done &amp;quot;almost any time&amp;quot; to make a thoroughfare.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; It is probable that &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Thomas Jefferson&lt;/a&gt; was the first influential person who took an interest in cleaning up the brush that covered the land.

Trees and shrubs were planted, and the garden was maintained as well as scanty funds would permit until the institute expired in 1837, one year before the termination of its charter.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-botanical-3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; On May 26, 1824, the grounds were extended and in 1825, they were enclosed. &amp;quot;There seems to be no record of what improvements or plantings were made by the Columbian Institute. The institute had expended $1,500 on the grounds for walks and plantings and had asked Congress to be reimbursed, but this request was not granted.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-elliott-6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt; Although the membership roster of the Columbian Institution included many distinguished citizens and several presidents, they were unable to raise money for the greenhouse and lecture hall.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; Meetings were held in a variety of temporary offices, including a committee room in the capitol building that Congress granted use of on December 20, 1828.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-rooms-10&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[11]&lt;/a&gt; Despite all the hardships, the Institute quickly launched an enthusiastic effort to collect plants and seeds.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; In 1826, a committee was appointed to meet with heads of government departments to help solicit &amp;quot;all subjects of natural history that may be deemed interesting&amp;quot; from foreign representatives. The following year, Secretary of the Treasury, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Rush&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Richard Rush&lt;/a&gt; was also involved in the solicitation by circulating a letter to foreign dignitaries.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; In the letter he stated that President &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;John Quincy Adams&lt;/a&gt; was &amp;quot;desirous of causing to be introduced into the United States all such trees and plants from other countries not heretofore known in the United States, as may give promise, under proper cultivation, of flourishing and becoming useful....&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; The publicity was extremely successful. Plants and seeds made their way to the Institute from as far away as China and Brazil. Some came from areas nearby, such as Montgomery County in Maryland. In 1824, a &lt;i&gt;List of Plants in the Botanic Garden of the Columbian Institute&lt;/i&gt; was prepared by William Elliot.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; The pamphlet mentioned more than 458 plants growing at that time.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-elliott-6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt; Sixteen years passed and by 1836, no further improvements had been made on the property. &amp;quot;The tract was a stagnant and malarial swamp and Congress was prevailed upon to make an appropriation of $5,000 for improvements.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-improvements-11&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[12]&lt;/a&gt; The funds were used to drain the site and erect a fountain.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; Financial woes continued to plague the Institute, and there was &amp;quot;never enough money from contributions for proper maintenance of the garden and plant collections.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; The facility ceased to operate in 1837 when the society stopped holding meetings. However it was re-instituted in 1842 when the Wilkes expedition of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ocean&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt; brought back a collection of plants.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Wilkes exploring and surveying expedition&lt;/i&gt; In 1838, Lt. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Wilkes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Charles Wilkes&lt;/a&gt; set out on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Exploring_Expedition&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;United States Exploring Expedition&lt;/a&gt; commissioned by Congress&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumnavigation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;circumnavigate&lt;/a&gt; the globe and explore the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; Between the years 1838–1842, the expedition, consisting of six government ships, traveled 87,000 miles&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-garden-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; and collected a large assortment of horticultural and botanical specimens. These formed the nucleus of the present garden.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The expedition also confirmed that Antarctica was a continent.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-garden-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; The staff included a botanist, W.

Breckenridge who brought back a large collection of specimens, including seeds and cuttings.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-improvements-11&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[12]&lt;/a&gt; Because the garden was situated in a swamp, early attempts at cultivation were not successful, however, during 1842; a revival was made after the Wilkes Expedition brought many rare plants to Washington from the Fiji, Sandwich and Society Islands, New Zealand and South America. During this trip, Wilkes collected live and dried &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;specimens&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;plants&lt;/a&gt; and was one of the first to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardian_case&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;wardian cases&lt;/a&gt; to maintain live plants on long voyages. Members of the expedition returned with a massive collection of plants previously unknown in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The dried specimens comprised the core of what is now the &lt;b&gt;National Herbarium&lt;/b&gt;, an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbarium&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;herbarium&lt;/a&gt; curated by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Smithsonian Institution's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_Natural_History&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;National Museum of Natural History&lt;/a&gt;. The live Wilkes specimens and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;seeds&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;were transferred successively to frames in 1844 and to the Old Patent Office greenhouse, the first building on the site, where they remained until 1850.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-swamp-5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt; At that time, a botanic garden was built to house the collection in front of the Capitol, where the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflecting_pool&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reflecting pool&lt;/a&gt; is now located. They were moved again in 1934.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-swamp-5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;U.S. Botanic Garden&lt;/i&gt; The very tract of land the Botanical Garden of the Columbian Institute occupied, became the site of the United States Botanic Garden, established in 1850, thirteen years after the demise of the institute. In 1867, Congress provided money for the construction of the first greenhouses. The main conservatory building was erected, 30 feet long with a dome 60 feet high.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; Several historic trees stood on the site including the &lt;i&gt;Crittenden Oak&lt;/i&gt; which marks the spot where &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_J._Crittenden&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;John J. Crittenden&lt;/a&gt; made an address in an effort to avert the Civil War. Also, &lt;i&gt;the Beck-Washington Elm&lt;/i&gt; was a scion of an elm earlier planted by Washington himself. A plane tree which &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaddeus_Stevens&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Thaddeus Stevens&lt;/a&gt; brought from the &lt;i&gt;Vale of Cashmere&lt;/i&gt;, a sycamore planted by Senator &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Voorhees&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Daniel Voorhees&lt;/a&gt; and a Chinese oak from the grave of Confucius, two cedars of Lebanon, and several others that have historic associations.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; The &lt;i&gt;Bartholdl Fountain&lt;/i&gt;, the work of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%c3%a9d%c3%a9ric_Auguste_Bartholdi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi&lt;/a&gt;, the same sculptor who designed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Liberty&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Statue of Liberty&lt;/a&gt; in New York Harbor stood in a central site in the gardens, however, it was placed in storage for several years to make way for the memorial to General Meade, the hero of Gettysburg.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; The garden &amp;quot;was formally placed under the jurisdiction of the Joint Committee on the Library of Congress in 1856 and has been administered through the Office of the Architect of the Capitol since 1934. The Architect of the Capitol has served as Acting Director of the United States Botanic Garden and is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the Garden and for any construction, changes, or improvements made.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-architect-13&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[14]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Talk of expansion and move&lt;/i&gt; A discussion about moving the garden began in Congress in August, 1922. &amp;quot;It appears likely that the public features of the present garden will be transferred from the west side of the Capitol to the north side and that a new botanic garden and arboretum on an adequate scale will be established not far from the Capitol.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The site of the original garden was fewer than 13&amp;nbsp;acres (53,000 m2), in comparison to the famous Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in London, which had 288&amp;nbsp;acres (1.17&amp;nbsp;km2). The garden in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin,_Germany&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Berlin, Germany&lt;/a&gt;, has over 1,325&amp;nbsp;acres (5.36&amp;nbsp;km2) and was established at a cost of over $4,000,000. In comparison, $1,416,748 was spent on the garden in Washington between the years 1842–1922. This included the original appropriation for the Wilkes expedition.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; Senate resolution 165 was passed and a committee was formed to review the acquisition of a new site. Lieut. Col. Clarence O. Sherrill, Corps of Engineers, secretary and executive officer of the fine arts commission, compiled a report on the garden.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; It was felt that the botanic garden must be removed because when Congress established the location of the Grant Memorial in the garden-area, technically, it forced the garden out. &amp;quot;Such was the intention of Congress.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The action was entirely logical. That space was designed by President &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;George Washington&lt;/a&gt; and Maj. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Charles_L'Enfant&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pierre Charles L'Enfant&lt;/a&gt; as an open approach to the Capitol, which is shown on the original plan to the city. &amp;quot;It was proposed at that time that this area should be subject to ornamentation with memorials, foundations, and the like, but not shut off by walls and fences. Locating the Botanic Garden in this area was one of those serious mistakes made in the early part of the century whereby the great plan for the Nation's Capital suffered damage that has continued to this day.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; Sherrill's report pointed out that the goal of Congress was to restore the Mall to its original status as a park connection between the legislative and executive departments. Congress had paid the Pennsylvania Railroad $1,500,000 to remove its tracks from the Mall. &amp;quot;The new National Museum Building, the Agriculture Department buildings, and the gallery for the Freer collections all have been located with reference in the general plan. Slowly, but steadily, changes in conformity with that plan are now being carried out throughout the entire 2½ miles from the Capitol Grounds to the Lincoln Memorial. The removal of the Botanic Garden is essential to the development of the great composition.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;If Congress desires to continue a garden for the purpose of obtaining flowers for its members and for growing shrubs to disseminate throughout the country, both of these purposes can be subserved quite as well by glass houses and gardens in other accessible locations.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; It was also felt that the new location would provide enlargement of the Capitol Grounds on the north which affords an area for gardens of great beauty and distinction &amp;quot;through which will pass all visitors to Washington and a large proportion of those persons who daily go to the Capitol and Library of Congress.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The old location was seen as assessable to only &amp;quot;an insignificant fraction of visitors or residents&amp;quot; and that the removal of the garden from the west side of the Capitol to the north side made the features of the garden more available.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; An exhaustive search was made of several areas available for garden purposes and Mount Hamilton, a privately owned site, was chosen. The tract fronted the Anacostia River and carried a variety of soils in such condition that &amp;quot;very little preparation for the uses of a botanic garden would be needed and very little grading other than that required for roads.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The tract had north, south, east and west slopes and a level area on Hickey Road that would work well for greenhouses and herbaceous gardens, while the other sloped areas would be ideal for shrub and small flowering-tree arboretum uses. The entire area contained about 400&amp;nbsp;acres (1.6&amp;nbsp;km2) and would &amp;quot;afford an entrance to Washington of unequaled beauty.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; In the future, it was felt that the garden could be expanded by &amp;quot;that portion of the park between the Pennsylvania Railroad and Benning Bridge contains about 563 acres, lowland and water, thus furnishing ample opportunity for expansion on land not subject to overflow for lowland and fresh-water exhibits.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The Commission of Fine Art made recommendation that the Mount Hamilton tract be acquired for a national botanic garden and arboretum; by purchasing 400&amp;nbsp;acres (1.6&amp;nbsp;km2) of land, at least 800&amp;nbsp;acres (3.2&amp;nbsp;km2) of Government-owned lands will be made available. Also, a park entrance to the city from the north will be provided. Additionally, the public features of the &amp;quot;present&amp;quot; Botanic Garden be transferred from the west side of the Capitol to the north side to lands already owned by the Government.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;New location&lt;/i&gt; In 1933, the main building was moved to its present location on the National Mall, just to the southwest of the Capitol, bordered by Maryland Avenue on the north, First Street on the east, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Avenue_(Washington_D.C.)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Independence Avenue&lt;/a&gt; on the south, and Third Street on the west.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-Botanic_Garden-2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; The facility includes a conservatory and 2&amp;nbsp;acres (8,100&amp;nbsp;m2) of outside grounds.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-14&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[15]&lt;/a&gt; Directly across Independence Avenue is Bartholdi Park, an outdoor display area, and an administration building.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-Botanic_Garden-2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-15&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[16]&lt;/a&gt; Located on 3&amp;nbsp;acres (12,000&amp;nbsp;m2) west of the conservatory and opened to the public on October 1, 2006, the National Garden provides living laboratories for environmental, horticultural, and botanical education.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-National_Garden-16&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[17]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-newsite-17&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[18]&lt;/a&gt; The major features of the National Garden are the Rose Garden, the Butterfly Garden, the Lawn Terrace, the First Ladies' Water Garden, the Regional Garden, and an outdoor amphitheater.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-National_Garden-16&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[17]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Plant production facility&lt;/i&gt; A plant production facility in Anacostia, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, includes greenhouse bays and a support facility for the garden. The &lt;i&gt;U.S. Botanic Garden Production Facility&lt;/i&gt;, covers 85,000&amp;nbsp;square feet (7,900&amp;nbsp;m2) under glass, and is the largest support facility for a botanic garden in the United States. It houses collections currently not on display, including plants recuperating. Seasonal plants are also grown at the facility for use in the Supreme Court, Library of Congress and for replenishing the Capitol grounds. An estimated 100,000 mums, pansies, cabbage, kale and other annuals and perennials per year are grown in the facility. Additionally, foliage plants for the Senate offices and palm trees for Capitol Hill events as well as special seasonal displays such as Easter lilies and poinsettias are all grown on site.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-production-0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;According to staff botanists, there are about 50,000 plants on hand at the production facility at any one time.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-production-0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Current operation&lt;/i&gt; Presently, the United States Botanic Garden is home to almost 10,000 living specimens, some of them over 165 years old.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-garden-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; The national monument was closed for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renovation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;renovations&lt;/a&gt; on September 1, 1997, and reopened to the public on December 11, 2001.

It is named for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartholdi_Fountain&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Bartholdi Fountain&lt;/a&gt; in the garden's center designed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%c3%a9d%c3%a9ric_Bartholdi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Frédéric Bartholdi&lt;/a&gt;. One of the goals of this garden is to provide inspiration and ideas for home gardeners who visit it. It displays a variety of small structured and non-structured gardens, and infuses color, shape, and planting themes. One section of the garden is certified as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Wildlife_Federation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;National Wildlife Federation&lt;/a&gt; Backyard Wildlife Habitat. The Park also houses the administrative building for the United States Botanic Garden. The Production Facility in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest,_Washington,_D.C.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;southwest D.C.&lt;/a&gt; is used for growing and storing plants for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_propagation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;propagation&lt;/a&gt;, for collection maintenance, or for display in upcoming annual shows. The USBG participates in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CITES&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CITES&lt;/a&gt; (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species), which means that it cares for plants seized by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Customs_and_Border_Protection&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Customs&lt;/a&gt;.

Because of the lifespan of Vessel Ferns, it is highly unlikely that the present fern is the original; however it is believed that the present fern is a direct descendant and genetically identical to the original. * The Ferocious Blue Cycad (&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalartos_horridus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Encephalartos horridus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycad&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cycad&lt;/a&gt; questionably one of the original Wilkes plants. Due to its size and possible age, some believe this plant to have come back with the expedition in 1842; unfortunately, early records are incomplete and inaccurate, so this is left to speculation. * The Queen Sagos &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycas_circinalis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cycas circinalis&lt;/a&gt;, which are cycads, live in the Garden Court.

He had been warned in 1796 that if he chose to plant crops &amp;quot;on the avenue and the Mall&amp;quot;, it was at his own risk as something might be done &amp;quot;almost any time&amp;quot; to make a thoroughfare.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; It is probable that &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Thomas Jefferson&lt;/a&gt; was the first influential person who took an interest in cleaning up the brush that covered the land. By 1810, some rows of Lombardy poplars had been planted, however, the avenue itself &amp;quot;was too much of a morass&amp;quot; to be traversed on horseback.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Botanic Garden of the Columbian Institute&lt;/i&gt; One of the greatest accomplishments of the institution was the creation of a botanic garden in 1821. &amp;quot;By the end of 1823 the swampy tract of land granted by Congress had been drained and leveled, an elliptical pond with an island at its center constructed, and four graveled walks laid out. Trees and shrubs were planted, and the garden was maintained as well as scanty funds would permit until the institute expired in 1837, one year before the termination of its charter.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-botanical-3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; On May 26, 1824, the grounds were extended and in 1825, they were enclosed. &amp;quot;There seems to be no record of what improvements or plantings were made by the Columbian Institute. The institute had expended $1,500 on the grounds for walks and plantings and had asked Congress to be reimbursed, but this request was not granted.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-elliott-6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt; Although the membership roster of the Columbian Institution included many distinguished citizens and several presidents, they were unable to raise money for the greenhouse and lecture hall.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; Meetings were held in a variety of temporary offices, including a committee room in the capitol building that Congress granted use of on December 20, 1828.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-rooms-10&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[11]&lt;/a&gt; Despite all the hardships, the Institute quickly launched an enthusiastic effort to collect plants and seeds.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; In 1826, a committee was appointed to meet with heads of government departments to help solicit &amp;quot;all subjects of natural history that may be deemed interesting&amp;quot; from foreign representatives. The following year, Secretary of the Treasury, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Rush&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Richard Rush&lt;/a&gt; was also involved in the solicitation by circulating a letter to foreign dignitaries.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; In the letter he stated that President &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;John Quincy Adams&lt;/a&gt; was &amp;quot;desirous of causing to be introduced into the United States all such trees and plants from other countries not heretofore known in the United States, as may give promise, under proper cultivation, of flourishing and becoming useful....&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; The publicity was extremely successful. Plants and seeds made their way to the Institute from as far away as China and Brazil. Some came from areas nearby, such as Montgomery County in Maryland. In 1824, a &lt;i&gt;List of Plants in the Botanic Garden of the Columbian Institute&lt;/i&gt; was prepared by William Elliot.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; The pamphlet mentioned more than 458 plants growing at that time.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-elliott-6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt; Sixteen years passed and by 1836, no further improvements had been made on the property. &amp;quot;The tract was a stagnant and malarial swamp and Congress was prevailed upon to make an appropriation of $5,000 for improvements.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-improvements-11&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[12]&lt;/a&gt; The funds were used to drain the site and erect a fountain.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; Financial woes continued to plague the Institute, and there was &amp;quot;never enough money from contributions for proper maintenance of the garden and plant collections.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; The facility ceased to operate in 1837 when the society stopped holding meetings. However it was re-instituted in 1842 when the Wilkes expedition of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ocean&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt; brought back a collection of plants.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Wilkes exploring and surveying expedition&lt;/i&gt; In 1838, Lt. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Wilkes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Charles Wilkes&lt;/a&gt; set out on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Exploring_Expedition&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;United States Exploring Expedition&lt;/a&gt; commissioned by Congress&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumnavigation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;circumnavigate&lt;/a&gt; the globe and explore the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; Between the years 1838–1842, the expedition, consisting of six government ships, traveled 87,000 miles&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-garden-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; and collected a large assortment of horticultural and botanical specimens.

During this trip, Wilkes collected live and dried &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;specimens&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;plants&lt;/a&gt; and was one of the first to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardian_case&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;wardian cases&lt;/a&gt; to maintain live plants on long voyages.

In 1867, Congress provided money for the construction of the first greenhouses. The main conservatory building was erected, 30 feet long with a dome 60 feet high.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; Several historic trees stood on the site including the &lt;i&gt;Crittenden Oak&lt;/i&gt; which marks the spot where &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_J._Crittenden&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;John J.

The Architect of the Capitol has served as Acting Director of the United States Botanic Garden and is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the Garden and for any construction, changes, or improvements made.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-architect-13&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[14]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Talk of expansion and move&lt;/i&gt; A discussion about moving the garden began in Congress in August, 1922. &amp;quot;It appears likely that the public features of the present garden will be transferred from the west side of the Capitol to the north side and that a new botanic garden and arboretum on an adequate scale will be established not far from the Capitol.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The site of the original garden was fewer than 13&amp;nbsp;acres (53,000 m2), in comparison to the famous Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in London, which had 288&amp;nbsp;acres (1.17&amp;nbsp;km2). The garden in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin,_Germany&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Berlin, Germany&lt;/a&gt;, has over 1,325&amp;nbsp;acres (5.36&amp;nbsp;km2) and was established at a cost of over $4,000,000. In comparison, $1,416,748 was spent on the garden in Washington between the years 1842–1922. This included the original appropriation for the Wilkes expedition.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; Senate resolution 165 was passed and a committee was formed to review the acquisition of a new site. Lieut. Col. Clarence O. Sherrill, Corps of Engineers, secretary and executive officer of the fine arts commission, compiled a report on the garden.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; It was felt that the botanic garden must be removed because when Congress established the location of the Grant Memorial in the garden-area, technically, it forced the garden out. &amp;quot;Such was the intention of Congress.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The action was entirely logical. That space was designed by President &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;George Washington&lt;/a&gt; and Maj. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Charles_L'Enfant&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pierre Charles L'Enfant&lt;/a&gt; as an open approach to the Capitol, which is shown on the original plan to the city. &amp;quot;It was proposed at that time that this area should be subject to ornamentation with memorials, foundations, and the like, but not shut off by walls and fences. Locating the Botanic Garden in this area was one of those serious mistakes made in the early part of the century whereby the great plan for the Nation's Capital suffered damage that has continued to this day.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; Sherrill's report pointed out that the goal of Congress was to restore the Mall to its original status as a park connection between the legislative and executive departments. Congress had paid the Pennsylvania Railroad $1,500,000 to remove its tracks from the Mall. &amp;quot;The new National Museum Building, the Agriculture Department buildings, and the gallery for the Freer collections all have been located with reference in the general plan. Slowly, but steadily, changes in conformity with that plan are now being carried out throughout the entire 2½ miles from the Capitol Grounds to the Lincoln Memorial. The removal of the Botanic Garden is essential to the development of the great composition.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;If Congress desires to continue a garden for the purpose of obtaining flowers for its members and for growing shrubs to disseminate throughout the country, both of these purposes can be subserved quite as well by glass houses and gardens in other accessible locations.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; It was also felt that the new location would provide enlargement of the Capitol Grounds on the north which affords an area for gardens of great beauty and distinction &amp;quot;through which will pass all visitors to Washington and a large proportion of those persons who daily go to the Capitol and Library of Congress.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The old location was seen as assessable to only &amp;quot;an insignificant fraction of visitors or residents&amp;quot; and that the removal of the garden from the west side of the Capitol to the north side made the features of the garden more available.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; An exhaustive search was made of several areas available for garden purposes and Mount Hamilton, a privately owned site, was chosen. The tract fronted the Anacostia River and carried a variety of soils in such condition that &amp;quot;very little preparation for the uses of a botanic garden would be needed and very little grading other than that required for roads.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The tract had north, south, east and west slopes and a level area on Hickey Road that would work well for greenhouses and herbaceous gardens, while the other sloped areas would be ideal for shrub and small flowering-tree arboretum uses. The entire area contained about 400&amp;nbsp;acres (1.6&amp;nbsp;km2) and would &amp;quot;afford an entrance to Washington of unequaled beauty.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; In the future, it was felt that the garden could be expanded by &amp;quot;that portion of the park between the Pennsylvania Railroad and Benning Bridge contains about 563 acres, lowland and water, thus furnishing ample opportunity for expansion on land not subject to overflow for lowland and fresh-water exhibits.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The Commission of Fine Art made recommendation that the Mount Hamilton tract be acquired for a national botanic garden and arboretum; by purchasing 400&amp;nbsp;acres (1.6&amp;nbsp;km2) of land, at least 800&amp;nbsp;acres (3.2&amp;nbsp;km2) of Government-owned lands will be made available. Also, a park entrance to the city from the north will be provided. Additionally, the public features of the &amp;quot;present&amp;quot; Botanic Garden be transferred from the west side of the Capitol to the north side to lands already owned by the Government.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;New location&lt;/i&gt; In 1933, the main building was moved to its present location on the National Mall, just to the southwest of the Capitol, bordered by Maryland Avenue on the north, First Street on the east, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Avenue_(Washington_D.C.)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Independence Avenue&lt;/a&gt; on the south, and Third Street on the west.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-Botanic_Garden-2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; The facility includes a conservatory and 2&amp;nbsp;acres (8,100&amp;nbsp;m2) of outside grounds.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-14&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[15]&lt;/a&gt; Directly across Independence Avenue is Bartholdi Park, an outdoor display area, and an administration building.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-Botanic_Garden-2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-15&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[16]&lt;/a&gt; Located on 3&amp;nbsp;acres (12,000&amp;nbsp;m2) west of the conservatory and opened to the public on October 1, 2006, the National Garden provides living laboratories for environmental, horticultural, and botanical education.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-National_Garden-16&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[17]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-newsite-17&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[18]&lt;/a&gt; The major features of the National Garden are the Rose Garden, the Butterfly Garden, the Lawn Terrace, the First Ladies' Water Garden, the Regional Garden, and an outdoor amphitheater.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-National_Garden-16&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[17]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Plant production facility&lt;/i&gt; A plant production facility in Anacostia, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, includes greenhouse bays and a support facility for the garden. The &lt;i&gt;U.S. Botanic Garden Production Facility&lt;/i&gt;, covers 85,000&amp;nbsp;square feet (7,900&amp;nbsp;m2) under glass, and is the largest support facility for a botanic garden in the United States. It houses collections currently not on display, including plants recuperating. Seasonal plants are also grown at the facility for use in the Supreme Court, Library of Congress and for replenishing the Capitol grounds. An estimated 100,000 mums, pansies, cabbage, kale and other annuals and perennials per year are grown in the facility. Additionally, foliage plants for the Senate offices and palm trees for Capitol Hill events as well as special seasonal displays such as Easter lilies and poinsettias are all grown on site.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-production-0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;According to staff botanists, there are about 50,000 plants on hand at the production facility at any one time.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-production-0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Current operation&lt;/i&gt; Presently, the United States Botanic Garden is home to almost 10,000 living specimens, some of them over 165 years old.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-garden-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; The national monument was closed for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renovation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;renovations&lt;/a&gt; on September 1, 1997, and reopened to the public on December 11, 2001.

He had been warned in 1796 that if he chose to plant crops &amp;quot;on the avenue and the Mall&amp;quot;, it was at his own risk as something might be done &amp;quot;almost any time&amp;quot; to make a thoroughfare.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; It is probable that &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Thomas Jefferson&lt;/a&gt; was the first influential person who took an interest in cleaning up the brush that covered the land. By 1810, some rows of Lombardy poplars had been planted, however, the avenue itself &amp;quot;was too much of a morass&amp;quot; to be traversed on horseback.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Botanic Garden of the Columbian Institute&lt;/i&gt; One of the greatest accomplishments of the institution was the creation of a botanic garden in 1821. &amp;quot;By the end of 1823 the swampy tract of land granted by Congress had been drained and leveled, an elliptical pond with an island at its center constructed, and four graveled walks laid out. Trees and shrubs were planted, and the garden was maintained as well as scanty funds would permit until the institute expired in 1837, one year before the termination of its charter.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-botanical-3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; On May 26, 1824, the grounds were extended and in 1825, they were enclosed. &amp;quot;There seems to be no record of what improvements or plantings were made by the Columbian Institute. The institute had expended $1,500 on the grounds for walks and plantings and had asked Congress to be reimbursed, but this request was not granted.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-elliott-6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt; Although the membership roster of the Columbian Institution included many distinguished citizens and several presidents, they were unable to raise money for the greenhouse and lecture hall.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; Meetings were held in a variety of temporary offices, including a committee room in the capitol building that Congress granted use of on December 20, 1828.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-rooms-10&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[11]&lt;/a&gt; Despite all the hardships, the Institute quickly launched an enthusiastic effort to collect plants and seeds.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; In 1826, a committee was appointed to meet with heads of government departments to help solicit &amp;quot;all subjects of natural history that may be deemed interesting&amp;quot; from foreign representatives. The following year, Secretary of the Treasury, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Rush&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Richard Rush&lt;/a&gt; was also involved in the solicitation by circulating a letter to foreign dignitaries.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; In the letter he stated that President &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;John Quincy Adams&lt;/a&gt; was &amp;quot;desirous of causing to be introduced into the United States all such trees and plants from other countries not heretofore known in the United States, as may give promise, under proper cultivation, of flourishing and becoming useful....&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; The publicity was extremely successful. Plants and seeds made their way to the Institute from as far away as China and Brazil. Some came from areas nearby, such as Montgomery County in Maryland. In 1824, a &lt;i&gt;List of Plants in the Botanic Garden of the Columbian Institute&lt;/i&gt; was prepared by William Elliot.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; The pamphlet mentioned more than 458 plants growing at that time.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-elliott-6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt; Sixteen years passed and by 1836, no further improvements had been made on the property. &amp;quot;The tract was a stagnant and malarial swamp and Congress was prevailed upon to make an appropriation of $5,000 for improvements.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-improvements-11&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[12]&lt;/a&gt; The funds were used to drain the site and erect a fountain.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; Financial woes continued to plague the Institute, and there was &amp;quot;never enough money from contributions for proper maintenance of the garden and plant collections.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; The facility ceased to operate in 1837 when the society stopped holding meetings. However it was re-instituted in 1842 when the Wilkes expedition of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ocean&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt; brought back a collection of plants.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Wilkes exploring and surveying expedition&lt;/i&gt; In 1838, Lt. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Wilkes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Charles Wilkes&lt;/a&gt; set out on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Exploring_Expedition&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;United States Exploring Expedition&lt;/a&gt; commissioned by Congress&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumnavigation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;circumnavigate&lt;/a&gt; the globe and explore the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; Between the years 1838–1842, the expedition, consisting of six government ships, traveled 87,000 miles&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-garden-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; and collected a large assortment of horticultural and botanical specimens. These formed the nucleus of the present garden.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The expedition also confirmed that Antarctica was a continent.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-garden-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; The staff included a botanist, W. D. Breckenridge who brought back a large collection of specimens, including seeds and cuttings.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-improvements-11&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[12]&lt;/a&gt; Because the garden was situated in a swamp, early attempts at cultivation were not successful, however, during 1842; a revival was made after the Wilkes Expedition brought many rare plants to Washington from the Fiji, Sandwich and Society Islands, New Zealand and South America. During this trip, Wilkes collected live and dried &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;specimens&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;plants&lt;/a&gt; and was one of the first to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardian_case&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;wardian cases&lt;/a&gt; to maintain live plants on long voyages. Members of the expedition returned with a massive collection of plants previously unknown in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The dried specimens comprised the core of what is now the &lt;b&gt;National Herbarium&lt;/b&gt;, an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbarium&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;herbarium&lt;/a&gt; curated by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Smithsonian Institution's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_Natural_History&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;National Museum of Natural History&lt;/a&gt;. The live Wilkes specimens and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;seeds&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;were transferred successively to frames in 1844 and to the Old Patent Office greenhouse, the first building on the site, where they remained until 1850.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-swamp-5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt; At that time, a botanic garden was built to house the collection in front of the Capitol, where the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflecting_pool&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reflecting pool&lt;/a&gt; is now located. They were moved again in 1934.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-swamp-5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;U.S. Botanic Garden&lt;/i&gt; The very tract of land the Botanical Garden of the Columbian Institute occupied, became the site of the United States Botanic Garden, established in 1850, thirteen years after the demise of the institute. In 1867, Congress provided money for the construction of the first greenhouses. The main conservatory building was erected, 30 feet long with a dome 60 feet high.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; Several historic trees stood on the site including the &lt;i&gt;Crittenden Oak&lt;/i&gt; which marks the spot where &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_J._Crittenden&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;John J. Crittenden&lt;/a&gt; made an address in an effort to avert the Civil War. Also, &lt;i&gt;the Beck-Washington Elm&lt;/i&gt; was a scion of an elm earlier planted by Washington himself. A plane tree which &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaddeus_Stevens&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Thaddeus Stevens&lt;/a&gt; brought from the &lt;i&gt;Vale of Cashmere&lt;/i&gt;, a sycamore planted by Senator &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Voorhees&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Daniel Voorhees&lt;/a&gt; and a Chinese oak from the grave of Confucius, two cedars of Lebanon, and several others that have historic associations.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; The &lt;i&gt;Bartholdl Fountain&lt;/i&gt;, the work of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%c3%a9d%c3%a9ric_Auguste_Bartholdi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi&lt;/a&gt;, the same sculptor who designed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Liberty&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Statue of Liberty&lt;/a&gt; in New York Harbor stood in a central site in the gardens, however, it was placed in storage for several years to make way for the memorial to General Meade, the hero of Gettysburg.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; The garden &amp;quot;was formally placed under the jurisdiction of the Joint Committee on the Library of Congress in 1856 and has been administered through the Office of the Architect of the Capitol since 1934. The Architect of the Capitol has served as Acting Director of the United States Botanic Garden and is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the Garden and for any construction, changes, or improvements made.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-architect-13&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[14]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Talk of expansion and move&lt;/i&gt; A discussion about moving the garden began in Congress in August, 1922. &amp;quot;It appears likely that the public features of the present garden will be transferred from the west side of the Capitol to the north side and that a new botanic garden and arboretum on an adequate scale will be established not far from the Capitol.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The site of the original garden was fewer than 13&amp;nbsp;acres (53,000 m2), in comparison to the famous Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in London, which had 288&amp;nbsp;acres (1.17&amp;nbsp;km2). The garden in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin,_Germany&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Berlin, Germany&lt;/a&gt;, has over 1,325&amp;nbsp;acres (5.36&amp;nbsp;km2) and was established at a cost of over $4,000,000. In comparison, $1,416,748 was spent on the garden in Washington between the years 1842–1922. This included the original appropriation for the Wilkes expedition.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; Senate resolution 165 was passed and a committee was formed to review the acquisition of a new site. Lieut. Col. Clarence O. Sherrill, Corps of Engineers, secretary and executive officer of the fine arts commission, compiled a report on the garden.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; It was felt that the botanic garden must be removed because when Congress established the location of the Grant Memorial in the garden-area, technically, it forced the garden out. &amp;quot;Such was the intention of Congress.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The action was entirely logical. That space was designed by President &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;George Washington&lt;/a&gt; and Maj. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Charles_L'Enfant&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pierre Charles L'Enfant&lt;/a&gt; as an open approach to the Capitol, which is shown on the original plan to the city. &amp;quot;It was proposed at that time that this area should be subject to ornamentation with memorials, foundations, and the like, but not shut off by walls and fences. Locating the Botanic Garden in this area was one of those serious mistakes made in the early part of the century whereby the great plan for the Nation's Capital suffered damage that has continued to this day.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; Sherrill's report pointed out that the goal of Congress was to restore the Mall to its original status as a park connection between the legislative and executive departments. Congress had paid the Pennsylvania Railroad $1,500,000 to remove its tracks from the Mall. &amp;quot;The new National Museum Building, the Agriculture Department buildings, and the gallery for the Freer collections all have been located with reference in the general plan. Slowly, but steadily, changes in conformity with that plan are now being carried out throughout the entire 2½ miles from the Capitol Grounds to the Lincoln Memorial. The removal of the Botanic Garden is essential to the development of the great composition.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;If Congress desires to continue a garden for the purpose of obtaining flowers for its members and for growing shrubs to disseminate throughout the country, both of these purposes can be subserved quite as well by glass houses and gardens in other accessible locations.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; It was also felt that the new location would provide enlargement of the Capitol Grounds on the north which affords an area for gardens of great beauty and distinction &amp;quot;through which will pass all visitors to Washington and a large proportion of those persons who daily go to the Capitol and Library of Congress.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The old location was seen as assessable to only &amp;quot;an insignificant fraction of visitors or residents&amp;quot; and that the removal of the garden from the west side of the Capitol to the north side made the features of the garden more available.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; An exhaustive search was made of several areas available for garden purposes and Mount Hamilton, a privately owned site, was chosen. The tract fronted the Anacostia River and carried a variety of soils in such condition that &amp;quot;very little preparation for the uses of a botanic garden would be needed and very little grading other than that required for roads.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The tract had north, south, east and west slopes and a level area on Hickey Road that would work well for greenhouses and herbaceous gardens, while the other sloped areas would be ideal for shrub and small flowering-tree arboretum uses. The entire area contained about 400&amp;nbsp;acres (1.6&amp;nbsp;km2) and would &amp;quot;afford an entrance to Washington of unequaled beauty.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; In the future, it was felt that the garden could be expanded by &amp;quot;that portion of the park between the Pennsylvania Railroad and Benning Bridge contains about 563 acres, lowland and water, thus furnishing ample opportunity for expansion on land not subject to overflow for lowland and fresh-water exhibits.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The Commission of Fine Art made recommendation that the Mount Hamilton tract be acquired for a national botanic garden and arboretum; by purchasing 400&amp;nbsp;acres (1.6&amp;nbsp;km2) of land, at least 800&amp;nbsp;acres (3.2&amp;nbsp;km2) of Government-owned lands will be made available. Also, a park entrance to the city from the north will be provided. Additionally, the public features of the &amp;quot;present&amp;quot; Botanic Garden be transferred from the west side of the Capitol to the north side to lands already owned by the Government.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;New location&lt;/i&gt; In 1933, the main building was moved to its present location on the National Mall, just to the southwest of the Capitol, bordered by Maryland Avenue on the north, First Street on the east, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Avenue_(Washington_D.C.)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Independence Avenue&lt;/a&gt; on the south, and Third Street on the west.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-Botanic_Garden-2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; The facility includes a conservatory and 2&amp;nbsp;acres (8,100&amp;nbsp;m2) of outside grounds.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-14&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[15]&lt;/a&gt; Directly across Independence Avenue is Bartholdi Park, an outdoor display area, and an administration building.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-Botanic_Garden-2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-15&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[16]&lt;/a&gt; Located on 3&amp;nbsp;acres (12,000&amp;nbsp;m2) west of the conservatory and opened to the public on October 1, 2006, the National Garden provides living laboratories for environmental, horticultural, and botanical education.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-National_Garden-16&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[17]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-newsite-17&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[18]&lt;/a&gt; The major features of the National Garden are the Rose Garden, the Butterfly Garden, the Lawn Terrace, the First Ladies' Water Garden, the Regional Garden, and an outdoor amphitheater.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-National_Garden-16&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[17]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Plant production facility&lt;/i&gt; A plant production facility in Anacostia, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, includes greenhouse bays and a support facility for the garden. The &lt;i&gt;U.S. Botanic Garden Production Facility&lt;/i&gt;, covers 85,000&amp;nbsp;square feet (7,900&amp;nbsp;m2) under glass, and is the largest support facility for a botanic garden in the United States. It houses collections currently not on display, including plants recuperating. Seasonal plants are also grown at the facility for use in the Supreme Court, Library of Congress and for replenishing the Capitol grounds. An estimated 100,000 mums, pansies, cabbage, kale and other annuals and perennials per year are grown in the facility. Additionally, foliage plants for the Senate offices and palm trees for Capitol Hill events as well as special seasonal displays such as Easter lilies and poinsettias are all grown on site.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-production-0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;According to staff botanists, there are about 50,000 plants on hand at the production facility at any one time.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-production-0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Current operation&lt;/i&gt; Presently, the United States Botanic Garden is home to almost 10,000 living specimens, some of them over 165 years old.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-garden-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; The national monument was closed for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renovation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;renovations&lt;/a&gt; on September 1, 1997, and reopened to the public on December 11, 2001.

Because of the lifespan of Vessel Ferns, it is highly unlikely that the present fern is the original; however it is believed that the present fern is a direct descendant and genetically identical to the original. * The Ferocious Blue Cycad (&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalartos_horridus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Encephalartos horridus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycad&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cycad&lt;/a&gt; questionably one of the original Wilkes plants. Due to its size and possible age, some believe this plant to have come back with the expedition in 1842; unfortunately, early records are incomplete and inaccurate, so this is left to speculation. * The Queen Sagos &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycas_circinalis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cycas circinalis&lt;/a&gt;, which are cycads, live in the Garden Court.

By 1810, some rows of Lombardy poplars had been planted, however, the avenue itself &amp;quot;was too much of a morass&amp;quot; to be traversed on horseback.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Botanic Garden of the Columbian Institute&lt;/i&gt; One of the greatest accomplishments of the institution was the creation of a botanic garden in 1821. &amp;quot;By the end of 1823 the swampy tract of land granted by Congress had been drained and leveled, an elliptical pond with an island at its center constructed, and four graveled walks laid out. Trees and shrubs were planted, and the garden was maintained as well as scanty funds would permit until the institute expired in 1837, one year before the termination of its charter.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-botanical-3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; On May 26, 1824, the grounds were extended and in 1825, they were enclosed. &amp;quot;There seems to be no record of what improvements or plantings were made by the Columbian Institute. The institute had expended $1,500 on the grounds for walks and plantings and had asked Congress to be reimbursed, but this request was not granted.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-elliott-6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt; Although the membership roster of the Columbian Institution included many distinguished citizens and several presidents, they were unable to raise money for the greenhouse and lecture hall.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; Meetings were held in a variety of temporary offices, including a committee room in the capitol building that Congress granted use of on December 20, 1828.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-rooms-10&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[11]&lt;/a&gt; Despite all the hardships, the Institute quickly launched an enthusiastic effort to collect plants and seeds.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; In 1826, a committee was appointed to meet with heads of government departments to help solicit &amp;quot;all subjects of natural history that may be deemed interesting&amp;quot; from foreign representatives. The following year, Secretary of the Treasury, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Rush&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Richard Rush&lt;/a&gt; was also involved in the solicitation by circulating a letter to foreign dignitaries.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; In the letter he stated that President &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;John Quincy Adams&lt;/a&gt; was &amp;quot;desirous of causing to be introduced into the United States all such trees and plants from other countries not heretofore known in the United States, as may give promise, under proper cultivation, of flourishing and becoming useful....&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; The publicity was extremely successful. Plants and seeds made their way to the Institute from as far away as China and Brazil. Some came from areas nearby, such as Montgomery County in Maryland. In 1824, a &lt;i&gt;List of Plants in the Botanic Garden of the Columbian Institute&lt;/i&gt; was prepared by William Elliot.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; The pamphlet mentioned more than 458 plants growing at that time.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-elliott-6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt; Sixteen years passed and by 1836, no further improvements had been made on the property. &amp;quot;The tract was a stagnant and malarial swamp and Congress was prevailed upon to make an appropriation of $5,000 for improvements.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-improvements-11&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[12]&lt;/a&gt; The funds were used to drain the site and erect a fountain.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; Financial woes continued to plague the Institute, and there was &amp;quot;never enough money from contributions for proper maintenance of the garden and plant collections.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; The facility ceased to operate in 1837 when the society stopped holding meetings. However it was re-instituted in 1842 when the Wilkes expedition of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ocean&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt; brought back a collection of plants.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Wilkes exploring and surveying expedition&lt;/i&gt; In 1838, Lt. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Wilkes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Charles Wilkes&lt;/a&gt; set out on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Exploring_Expedition&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;United States Exploring Expedition&lt;/a&gt; commissioned by Congress&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumnavigation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;circumnavigate&lt;/a&gt; the globe and explore the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; Between the years 1838–1842, the expedition, consisting of six government ships, traveled 87,000 miles&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-garden-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; and collected a large assortment of horticultural and botanical specimens. These formed the nucleus of the present garden.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The expedition also confirmed that Antarctica was a continent.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-garden-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; The staff included a botanist, W.

Breckenridge who brought back a large collection of specimens, including seeds and cuttings.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-improvements-11&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[12]&lt;/a&gt; Because the garden was situated in a swamp, early attempts at cultivation were not successful, however, during 1842; a revival was made after the Wilkes Expedition brought many rare plants to Washington from the Fiji, Sandwich and Society Islands, New Zealand and South America. During this trip, Wilkes collected live and dried &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;specimens&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;plants&lt;/a&gt; and was one of the first to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardian_case&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;wardian cases&lt;/a&gt; to maintain live plants on long voyages. Members of the expedition returned with a massive collection of plants previously unknown in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The dried specimens comprised the core of what is now the &lt;b&gt;National Herbarium&lt;/b&gt;, an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbarium&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;herbarium&lt;/a&gt; curated by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Smithsonian Institution's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_Natural_History&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;National Museum of Natural History&lt;/a&gt;. The live Wilkes specimens and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;seeds&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;were transferred successively to frames in 1844 and to the Old Patent Office greenhouse, the first building on the site, where they remained until 1850.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-swamp-5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt; At that time, a botanic garden was built to house the collection in front of the Capitol, where the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflecting_pool&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reflecting pool&lt;/a&gt; is now located. They were moved again in 1934.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-swamp-5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;U.S. Botanic Garden&lt;/i&gt; The very tract of land the Botanical Garden of the Columbian Institute occupied, became the site of the United States Botanic Garden, established in 1850, thirteen years after the demise of the institute. In 1867, Congress provided money for the construction of the first greenhouses. The main conservatory building was erected, 30 feet long with a dome 60 feet high.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; Several historic trees stood on the site including the &lt;i&gt;Crittenden Oak&lt;/i&gt; which marks the spot where &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_J._Crittenden&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;John J. Crittenden&lt;/a&gt; made an address in an effort to avert the Civil War. Also, &lt;i&gt;the Beck-Washington Elm&lt;/i&gt; was a scion of an elm earlier planted by Washington himself. A plane tree which &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaddeus_Stevens&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Thaddeus Stevens&lt;/a&gt; brought from the &lt;i&gt;Vale of Cashmere&lt;/i&gt;, a sycamore planted by Senator &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Voorhees&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Daniel Voorhees&lt;/a&gt; and a Chinese oak from the grave of Confucius, two cedars of Lebanon, and several others that have historic associations.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; The &lt;i&gt;Bartholdl Fountain&lt;/i&gt;, the work of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%c3%a9d%c3%a9ric_Auguste_Bartholdi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi&lt;/a&gt;, the same sculptor who designed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Liberty&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Statue of Liberty&lt;/a&gt; in New York Harbor stood in a central site in the gardens, however, it was placed in storage for several years to make way for the memorial to General Meade, the hero of Gettysburg.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; The garden &amp;quot;was formally placed under the jurisdiction of the Joint Committee on the Library of Congress in 1856 and has been administered through the Office of the Architect of the Capitol since 1934. The Architect of the Capitol has served as Acting Director of the United States Botanic Garden and is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the Garden and for any construction, changes, or improvements made.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-architect-13&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[14]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Talk of expansion and move&lt;/i&gt; A discussion about moving the garden began in Congress in August, 1922. &amp;quot;It appears likely that the public features of the present garden will be transferred from the west side of the Capitol to the north side and that a new botanic garden and arboretum on an adequate scale will be established not far from the Capitol.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The site of the original garden was fewer than 13&amp;nbsp;acres (53,000 m2), in comparison to the famous Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in London, which had 288&amp;nbsp;acres (1.17&amp;nbsp;km2). The garden in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin,_Germany&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Berlin, Germany&lt;/a&gt;, has over 1,325&amp;nbsp;acres (5.36&amp;nbsp;km2) and was established at a cost of over $4,000,000. In comparison, $1,416,748 was spent on the garden in Washington between the years 1842–1922. This included the original appropriation for the Wilkes expedition.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; Senate resolution 165 was passed and a committee was formed to review the acquisition of a new site. Lieut. Col. Clarence O. Sherrill, Corps of Engineers, secretary and executive officer of the fine arts commission, compiled a report on the garden.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; It was felt that the botanic garden must be removed because when Congress established the location of the Grant Memorial in the garden-area, technically, it forced the garden out. &amp;quot;Such was the intention of Congress.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The action was entirely logical. That space was designed by President &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;George Washington&lt;/a&gt; and Maj. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Charles_L'Enfant&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pierre Charles L'Enfant&lt;/a&gt; as an open approach to the Capitol, which is shown on the original plan to the city. &amp;quot;It was proposed at that time that this area should be subject to ornamentation with memorials, foundations, and the like, but not shut off by walls and fences. Locating the Botanic Garden in this area was one of those serious mistakes made in the early part of the century whereby the great plan for the Nation's Capital suffered damage that has continued to this day.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; Sherrill's report pointed out that the goal of Congress was to restore the Mall to its original status as a park connection between the legislative and executive departments. Congress had paid the Pennsylvania Railroad $1,500,000 to remove its tracks from the Mall. &amp;quot;The new National Museum Building, the Agriculture Department buildings, and the gallery for the Freer collections all have been located with reference in the general plan. Slowly, but steadily, changes in conformity with that plan are now being carried out throughout the entire 2½ miles from the Capitol Grounds to the Lincoln Memorial. The removal of the Botanic Garden is essential to the development of the great composition.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;If Congress desires to continue a garden for the purpose of obtaining flowers for its members and for growing shrubs to disseminate throughout the country, both of these purposes can be subserved quite as well by glass houses and gardens in other accessible locations.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; It was also felt that the new location would provide enlargement of the Capitol Grounds on the north which affords an area for gardens of great beauty and distinction &amp;quot;through which will pass all visitors to Washington and a large proportion of those persons who daily go to the Capitol and Library of Congress.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The old location was seen as assessable to only &amp;quot;an insignificant fraction of visitors or residents&amp;quot; and that the removal of the garden from the west side of the Capitol to the north side made the features of the garden more available.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; An exhaustive search was made of several areas available for garden purposes and Mount Hamilton, a privately owned site, was chosen. The tract fronted the Anacostia River and carried a variety of soils in such condition that &amp;quot;very little preparation for the uses of a botanic garden would be needed and very little grading other than that required for roads.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The tract had north, south, east and west slopes and a level area on Hickey Road that would work well for greenhouses and herbaceous gardens, while the other sloped areas would be ideal for shrub and small flowering-tree arboretum uses. The entire area contained about 400&amp;nbsp;acres (1.6&amp;nbsp;km2) and would &amp;quot;afford an entrance to Washington of unequaled beauty.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; In the future, it was felt that the garden could be expanded by &amp;quot;that portion of the park between the Pennsylvania Railroad and Benning Bridge contains about 563 acres, lowland and water, thus furnishing ample opportunity for expansion on land not subject to overflow for lowland and fresh-water exhibits.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The Commission of Fine Art made recommendation that the Mount Hamilton tract be acquired for a national botanic garden and arboretum; by purchasing 400&amp;nbsp;acres (1.6&amp;nbsp;km2) of land, at least 800&amp;nbsp;acres (3.2&amp;nbsp;km2) of Government-owned lands will be made available. Also, a park entrance to the city from the north will be provided. Additionally, the public features of the &amp;quot;present&amp;quot; Botanic Garden be transferred from the west side of the Capitol to the north side to lands already owned by the Government.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;New location&lt;/i&gt; In 1933, the main building was moved to its present location on the National Mall, just to the southwest of the Capitol, bordered by Maryland Avenue on the north, First Street on the east, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Avenue_(Washington_D.C.)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Independence Avenue&lt;/a&gt; on the south, and Third Street on the west.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-Botanic_Garden-2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; The facility includes a conservatory and 2&amp;nbsp;acres (8,100&amp;nbsp;m2) of outside grounds.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-14&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[15]&lt;/a&gt; Directly across Independence Avenue is Bartholdi Park, an outdoor display area, and an administration building.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-Botanic_Garden-2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-15&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[16]&lt;/a&gt; Located on 3&amp;nbsp;acres (12,000&amp;nbsp;m2) west of the conservatory and opened to the public on October 1, 2006, the National Garden provides living laboratories for environmental, horticultural, and botanical education.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-National_Garden-16&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[17]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-newsite-17&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[18]&lt;/a&gt; The major features of the National Garden are the Rose Garden, the Butterfly Garden, the Lawn Terrace, the First Ladies' Water Garden, the Regional Garden, and an outdoor amphitheater.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-National_Garden-16&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[17]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Plant production facility&lt;/i&gt; A plant production facility in Anacostia, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, includes greenhouse bays and a support facility for the garden. The &lt;i&gt;U.S. Botanic Garden Production Facility&lt;/i&gt;, covers 85,000&amp;nbsp;square feet (7,900&amp;nbsp;m2) under glass, and is the largest support facility for a botanic garden in the United States. It houses collections currently not on display, including plants recuperating. Seasonal plants are also grown at the facility for use in the Supreme Court, Library of Congress and for replenishing the Capitol grounds. An estimated 100,000 mums, pansies, cabbage, kale and other annuals and perennials per year are grown in the facility. Additionally, foliage plants for the Senate offices and palm trees for Capitol Hill events as well as special seasonal displays such as Easter lilies and poinsettias are all grown on site.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-production-0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;According to staff botanists, there are about 50,000 plants on hand at the production facility at any one time.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-production-0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Current operation&lt;/i&gt; Presently, the United States Botanic Garden is home to almost 10,000 living specimens, some of them over 165 years old.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-garden-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; The national monument was closed for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renovation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;renovations&lt;/a&gt; on September 1, 1997, and reopened to the public on December 11, 2001.

It is named for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartholdi_Fountain&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Bartholdi Fountain&lt;/a&gt; in the garden's center designed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%c3%a9d%c3%a9ric_Bartholdi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Frédéric Bartholdi&lt;/a&gt;. One of the goals of this garden is to provide inspiration and ideas for home gardeners who visit it. It displays a variety of small structured and non-structured gardens, and infuses color, shape, and planting themes. One section of the garden is certified as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Wildlife_Federation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;National Wildlife Federation&lt;/a&gt; Backyard Wildlife Habitat. The Park also houses the administrative building for the United States Botanic Garden. The Production Facility in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest,_Washington,_D.C.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;southwest D.C.&lt;/a&gt; is used for growing and storing plants for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_propagation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;propagation&lt;/a&gt;, for collection maintenance, or for display in upcoming annual shows. The USBG participates in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CITES&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CITES&lt;/a&gt; (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species), which means that it cares for plants seized by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Customs_and_Border_Protection&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Customs&lt;/a&gt;.

Because of the lifespan of Vessel Ferns, it is highly unlikely that the present fern is the original; however it is believed that the present fern is a direct descendant and genetically identical to the original. * The Ferocious Blue Cycad (&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalartos_horridus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Encephalartos horridus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycad&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cycad&lt;/a&gt; questionably one of the original Wilkes plants. Due to its size and possible age, some believe this plant to have come back with the expedition in 1842; unfortunately, early records are incomplete and inaccurate, so this is left to speculation. * The Queen Sagos &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycas_circinalis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cycas circinalis&lt;/a&gt;, which are cycads, live in the Garden Court.

He had been warned in 1796 that if he chose to plant crops &amp;quot;on the avenue and the Mall&amp;quot;, it was at his own risk as something might be done &amp;quot;almost any time&amp;quot; to make a thoroughfare.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; It is probable that &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Thomas Jefferson&lt;/a&gt; was the first influential person who took an interest in cleaning up the brush that covered the land. By 1810, some rows of Lombardy poplars had been planted, however, the avenue itself &amp;quot;was too much of a morass&amp;quot; to be traversed on horseback.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Botanic Garden of the Columbian Institute&lt;/i&gt; One of the greatest accomplishments of the institution was the creation of a botanic garden in 1821. &amp;quot;By the end of 1823 the swampy tract of land granted by Congress had been drained and leveled, an elliptical pond with an island at its center constructed, and four graveled walks laid out. Trees and shrubs were planted, and the garden was maintained as well as scanty funds would permit until the institute expired in 1837, one year before the termination of its charter.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-botanical-3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; On May 26, 1824, the grounds were extended and in 1825, they were enclosed. &amp;quot;There seems to be no record of what improvements or plantings were made by the Columbian Institute. The institute had expended $1,500 on the grounds for walks and plantings and had asked Congress to be reimbursed, but this request was not granted.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-elliott-6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt; Although the membership roster of the Columbian Institution included many distinguished citizens and several presidents, they were unable to raise money for the greenhouse and lecture hall.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; Meetings were held in a variety of temporary offices, including a committee room in the capitol building that Congress granted use of on December 20, 1828.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-rooms-10&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[11]&lt;/a&gt; Despite all the hardships, the Institute quickly launched an enthusiastic effort to collect plants and seeds.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; In 1826, a committee was appointed to meet with heads of government departments to help solicit &amp;quot;all subjects of natural history that may be deemed interesting&amp;quot; from foreign representatives. The following year, Secretary of the Treasury, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Rush&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Richard Rush&lt;/a&gt; was also involved in the solicitation by circulating a letter to foreign dignitaries.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; In the letter he stated that President &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;John Quincy Adams&lt;/a&gt; was &amp;quot;desirous of causing to be introduced into the United States all such trees and plants from other countries not heretofore known in the United States, as may give promise, under proper cultivation, of flourishing and becoming useful....&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; The publicity was extremely successful. Plants and seeds made their way to the Institute from as far away as China and Brazil. Some came from areas nearby, such as Montgomery County in Maryland. In 1824, a &lt;i&gt;List of Plants in the Botanic Garden of the Columbian Institute&lt;/i&gt; was prepared by William Elliot.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; The pamphlet mentioned more than 458 plants growing at that time.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-elliott-6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt; Sixteen years passed and by 1836, no further improvements had been made on the property. &amp;quot;The tract was a stagnant and malarial swamp and Congress was prevailed upon to make an appropriation of $5,000 for improvements.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-improvements-11&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[12]&lt;/a&gt; The funds were used to drain the site and erect a fountain.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; Financial woes continued to plague the Institute, and there was &amp;quot;never enough money from contributions for proper maintenance of the garden and plant collections.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; The facility ceased to operate in 1837 when the society stopped holding meetings. However it was re-instituted in 1842 when the Wilkes expedition of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ocean&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt; brought back a collection of plants.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Wilkes exploring and surveying expedition&lt;/i&gt; In 1838, Lt. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Wilkes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Charles Wilkes&lt;/a&gt; set out on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Exploring_Expedition&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;United States Exploring Expedition&lt;/a&gt; commissioned by Congress&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumnavigation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;circumnavigate&lt;/a&gt; the globe and explore the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-poor-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; Between the years 1838–1842, the expedition, consisting of six government ships, traveled 87,000 miles&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-garden-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; and collected a large assortment of horticultural and botanical specimens. These formed the nucleus of the present garden.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The expedition also confirmed that Antarctica was a continent.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-garden-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; The staff included a botanist, W. D. Breckenridge who brought back a large collection of specimens, including seeds and cuttings.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-improvements-11&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[12]&lt;/a&gt; Because the garden was situated in a swamp, early attempts at cultivation were not successful, however, during 1842; a revival was made after the Wilkes Expedition brought many rare plants to Washington from the Fiji, Sandwich and Society Islands, New Zealand and South America. During this trip, Wilkes collected live and dried &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;specimens&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;plants&lt;/a&gt; and was one of the first to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardian_case&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;wardian cases&lt;/a&gt; to maintain live plants on long voyages. Members of the expedition returned with a massive collection of plants previously unknown in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The dried specimens comprised the core of what is now the &lt;b&gt;National Herbarium&lt;/b&gt;, an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbarium&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;herbarium&lt;/a&gt; curated by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Smithsonian Institution's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_Natural_History&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;National Museum of Natural History&lt;/a&gt;. The live Wilkes specimens and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;seeds&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;were transferred successively to frames in 1844 and to the Old Patent Office greenhouse, the first building on the site, where they remained until 1850.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-swamp-5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt; At that time, a botanic garden was built to house the collection in front of the Capitol, where the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflecting_pool&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reflecting pool&lt;/a&gt; is now located. They were moved again in 1934.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-swamp-5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;U.S. Botanic Garden&lt;/i&gt; The very tract of land the Botanical Garden of the Columbian Institute occupied, became the site of the United States Botanic Garden, established in 1850, thirteen years after the demise of the institute. In 1867, Congress provided money for the construction of the first greenhouses. The main conservatory building was erected, 30 feet long with a dome 60 feet high.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; Several historic trees stood on the site including the &lt;i&gt;Crittenden Oak&lt;/i&gt; which marks the spot where &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_J._Crittenden&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;John J. Crittenden&lt;/a&gt; made an address in an effort to avert the Civil War. Also, &lt;i&gt;the Beck-Washington Elm&lt;/i&gt; was a scion of an elm earlier planted by Washington himself. A plane tree which &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaddeus_Stevens&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Thaddeus Stevens&lt;/a&gt; brought from the &lt;i&gt;Vale of Cashmere&lt;/i&gt;, a sycamore planted by Senator &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Voorhees&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Daniel Voorhees&lt;/a&gt; and a Chinese oak from the grave of Confucius, two cedars of Lebanon, and several others that have historic associations.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; The &lt;i&gt;Bartholdl Fountain&lt;/i&gt;, the work of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%c3%a9d%c3%a9ric_Auguste_Bartholdi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi&lt;/a&gt;, the same sculptor who designed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Liberty&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Statue of Liberty&lt;/a&gt; in New York Harbor stood in a central site in the gardens, however, it was placed in storage for several years to make way for the memorial to General Meade, the hero of Gettysburg.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-fountain-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; The garden &amp;quot;was formally placed under the jurisdiction of the Joint Committee on the Library of Congress in 1856 and has been administered through the Office of the Architect of the Capitol since 1934. The Architect of the Capitol has served as Acting Director of the United States Botanic Garden and is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the Garden and for any construction, changes, or improvements made.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-architect-13&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[14]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Talk of expansion and move&lt;/i&gt; A discussion about moving the garden began in Congress in August, 1922. &amp;quot;It appears likely that the public features of the present garden will be transferred from the west side of the Capitol to the north side and that a new botanic garden and arboretum on an adequate scale will be established not far from the Capitol.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The site of the original garden was fewer than 13&amp;nbsp;acres (53,000 m2), in comparison to the famous Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in London, which had 288&amp;nbsp;acres (1.17&amp;nbsp;km2). The garden in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin,_Germany&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Berlin, Germany&lt;/a&gt;, has over 1,325&amp;nbsp;acres (5.36&amp;nbsp;km2) and was established at a cost of over $4,000,000. In comparison, $1,416,748 was spent on the garden in Washington between the years 1842–1922. This included the original appropriation for the Wilkes expedition.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; Senate resolution 165 was passed and a committee was formed to review the acquisition of a new site. Lieut. Col. Clarence O. Sherrill, Corps of Engineers, secretary and executive officer of the fine arts commission, compiled a report on the garden.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; It was felt that the botanic garden must be removed because when Congress established the location of the Grant Memorial in the garden-area, technically, it forced the garden out. &amp;quot;Such was the intention of Congress.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The action was entirely logical. That space was designed by President &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;George Washington&lt;/a&gt; and Maj. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Charles_L'Enfant&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pierre Charles L'Enfant&lt;/a&gt; as an open approach to the Capitol, which is shown on the original plan to the city. &amp;quot;It was proposed at that time that this area should be subject to ornamentation with memorials, foundations, and the like, but not shut off by walls and fences. Locating the Botanic Garden in this area was one of those serious mistakes made in the early part of the century whereby the great plan for the Nation's Capital suffered damage that has continued to this day.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; Sherrill's report pointed out that the goal of Congress was to restore the Mall to its original status as a park connection between the legislative and executive departments. Congress had paid the Pennsylvania Railroad $1,500,000 to remove its tracks from the Mall. &amp;quot;The new National Museum Building, the Agriculture Department buildings, and the gallery for the Freer collections all have been located with reference in the general plan. Slowly, but steadily, changes in conformity with that plan are now being carried out throughout the entire 2½ miles from the Capitol Grounds to the Lincoln Memorial. The removal of the Botanic Garden is essential to the development of the great composition.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;If Congress desires to continue a garden for the purpose of obtaining flowers for its members and for growing shrubs to disseminate throughout the country, both of these purposes can be subserved quite as well by glass houses and gardens in other accessible locations.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; It was also felt that the new location would provide enlargement of the Capitol Grounds on the north which affords an area for gardens of great beauty and distinction &amp;quot;through which will pass all visitors to Washington and a large proportion of those persons who daily go to the Capitol and Library of Congress.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The old location was seen as assessable to only &amp;quot;an insignificant fraction of visitors or residents&amp;quot; and that the removal of the garden from the west side of the Capitol to the north side made the features of the garden more available.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; An exhaustive search was made of several areas available for garden purposes and Mount Hamilton, a privately owned site, was chosen. The tract fronted the Anacostia River and carried a variety of soils in such condition that &amp;quot;very little preparation for the uses of a botanic garden would be needed and very little grading other than that required for roads.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The tract had north, south, east and west slopes and a level area on Hickey Road that would work well for greenhouses and herbaceous gardens, while the other sloped areas would be ideal for shrub and small flowering-tree arboretum uses. The entire area contained about 400&amp;nbsp;acres (1.6&amp;nbsp;km2) and would &amp;quot;afford an entrance to Washington of unequaled beauty.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; In the future, it was felt that the garden could be expanded by &amp;quot;that portion of the park between the Pennsylvania Railroad and Benning Bridge contains about 563 acres, lowland and water, thus furnishing ample opportunity for expansion on land not subject to overflow for lowland and fresh-water exhibits.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The Commission of Fine Art made recommendation that the Mount Hamilton tract be acquired for a national botanic garden and arboretum; by purchasing 400&amp;nbsp;acres (1.6&amp;nbsp;km2) of land, at least 800&amp;nbsp;acres (3.2&amp;nbsp;km2) of Government-owned lands will be made available. Also, a park entrance to the city from the north will be provided. Additionally, the public features of the &amp;quot;present&amp;quot; Botanic Garden be transferred from the west side of the Capitol to the north side to lands already owned by the Government.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-moved-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;New location&lt;/i&gt; In 1933, the main building was moved to its present location on the National Mall, just to the southwest of the Capitol, bordered by Maryland Avenue on the north, First Street on the east, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Avenue_(Washington_D.C.)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Independence Avenue&lt;/a&gt; on the south, and Third Street on the west.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-Botanic_Garden-2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; The facility includes a conservatory and 2&amp;nbsp;acres (8,100&amp;nbsp;m2) of outside grounds.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-14&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[15]&lt;/a&gt; Directly across Independence Avenue is Bartholdi Park, an outdoor display area, and an administration building.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-Botanic_Garden-2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-15&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[16]&lt;/a&gt; Located on 3&amp;nbsp;acres (12,000&amp;nbsp;m2) west of the conservatory and opened to the public on October 1, 2006, the National Garden provides living laboratories for environmental, horticultural, and botanical education.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-National_Garden-16&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[17]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-newsite-17&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[18]&lt;/a&gt; The major features of the National Garden are the Rose Garden, the Butterfly Garden, the Lawn Terrace, the First Ladies' Water Garden, the Regional Garden, and an outdoor amphitheater.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-National_Garden-16&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[17]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Plant production facility&lt;/i&gt; A plant production facility in Anacostia, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, includes greenhouse bays and a support facility for the garden. The &lt;i&gt;U.S. Botanic Garden Production Facility&lt;/i&gt;, covers 85,000&amp;nbsp;square feet (7,900&amp;nbsp;m2) under glass, and is the largest support facility for a botanic garden in the United States. It houses collections currently not on display, including plants recuperating. Seasonal plants are also grown at the facility for use in the Supreme Court, Library of Congress and for replenishing the Capitol grounds. An estimated 100,000 mums, pansies, cabbage, kale and other annuals and perennials per year are grown in the facility. Additionally, foliage plants for the Senate offices and palm trees for Capitol Hill events as well as special seasonal displays such as Easter lilies and poinsettias are all grown on site.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-production-0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;According to staff botanists, there are about 50,000 plants on hand at the production facility at any one time.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-production-0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Current operation&lt;/i&gt; Presently, the United States Botanic Garden is home to almost 10,000 living specimens, some of them over 165 years old.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Botanic_Garden#cite_note-garden-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; The national monument was closed for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renovation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;renovations&lt;/a&gt; on September 1, 1997, and reopened to the public on December 11, 2001.

It is named for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartholdi_Fountain&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Bartholdi Fountain&lt;/a&gt; in the garden's center designed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%c3%a9d%c3%a9ric_Bartholdi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Frédéric Bartholdi&lt;/a&gt;. One of the goals of this garden is to provide inspiration and ideas for home gardeners who visit it. It displays a variety of small structured and non-structured gardens, and infuses color, shape, and planting themes. One section of the garden is certified as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Wildlife_Federation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;National Wildlife Federation&lt;/a&gt; Backyard Wildlife Habitat. The Park also houses the administrative building for the United States Botanic Garden. The Production Facility in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest,_Washington,_D.C.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;southwest D.C.&lt;/a&gt; is used for growing and storing plants for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_propagation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;propagation&lt;/a&gt;, for collection maintenance, or for display in upcoming annual shows. The USBG participates in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CITES&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CITES&lt;/a&gt; (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species), which means that it cares for plants seized by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Customs_and_Border_Protection&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Customs&lt;/a&gt;.

Because of the lifespan of Vessel Ferns, it is highly unlikely that the present fern is the original; however it is believed that the present fern is a direct descendant and genetically identical to the original. * The Ferocious Blue Cycad (&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalartos_horridus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Encephalartos horridus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycad&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cycad&lt;/a&gt; questionably one of the original Wilkes plants. Due to its size and possible age, some believe this plant to have come back with the expedition in 1842; unfortunately, early records are incomplete and inaccurate, so this is left to speculation. * The Queen Sagos &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycas_circinalis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cycas circinalis&lt;/a&gt;, which are cycads, live in the Garden Court.

<photo  date_taken="2012-01-07 01:33:40" description="5418. Here is a short extract from the Stan Nicholls 'HMAS SHROPSHIRE online book dealing with the cruisers call at Cape Town, where she has berthed here at 'J' Wharf in the Duncan Basin. Although things lookbright here the Victory contingent's arrangements were hampered by inclement weather. Nicholls writes: Our victory contingent was to have marched through Cape Town but this had to be cancelled due to bad weather. The group was bitterly disappointed to miss this opportunity for a 'dress rehearsal'. Captain Showers reported that the hospitality given by the people of Cape Town was overwhelming and in addition to many personal invitations the South African Women's Auxiliary Services' and the 'Australian and New Zealand Association' arranged dances at the Bohemia Club for the officers and at the mayor's garden canteen for the ratings. The ladies from these associations arranged many car trips to visit places of interest enabling many of Shropshire's ship's company and passengers to see a good deal of the countryside. A return cocktail party in Shropshire was arranged for officials and our hosts and hostesses from these two associations on 10 May 1946 but due to the weather, it was held in the ward room with some guests spilling over into the keyboard flat. During this time our sick bay had to contend with the usual minor medical upsets from crew and passengers. A touch of drama occurred when an appendix operation on one passenger was done. The Royal Naval Hospital, Simonstown requested a passage for a cot-case to the United Kingdom so they had at least two 'genuine' sick people to look after. Despite heavy rain, a large crowd gathered to farewell SHROPSHIRE when she sailed on 11 May at 1100. Captain Showers later reported that the conduct of all who went ashore in Cape Town was most satisfactory and further added that he received a letter from Commander-in-Chief, Vice-Admiral Sir Robert Burnett, which read: 'You and the General might be glad to know of the very fine impression all your lassies and lads made on the people of Cape Town. I as British C-in-C and a Scotsman, receive reflected glory and as head of the services here, am grateful and proud.' Well, all that seems to have been highly satisfactory. NOTE; The Australia War Memorial identifies the location of this photograph as Gibraltar on SHROPSHIRE's return voyage to Australia in July-August 1946. With the help of friends [comments below] we have been looking at port photographs and another image of SHROPSHIRE's arrival in the Duncan Basin there, and have elected to stay with that original location note.

Mid Caption: Mid Caption: Soldiers, sailors and airmen of Australia’s Federation Guard (AFG) participated in the Turkish International Service at the Çanakkale Martyrs' Memorial on the Gallipoli Peninsular on the eve of Anzac Day. The International Service commemorated the Gallipoli campaign, known in Turkey as the Çanakkale War after the nearby coastal city of Çanakkale. The service paid homage to the fallen of Turkey, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Germany, France, the UK, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The AFG contingent marched past the Governor General of Australia, Her Excellency Ms Quentin Bryce, AC. Ms Bryce also laid a wreath for Australia’s fallen at the memorial, and addressed the assembled Turkish and international dignitaries. The Çanakkale Martyrs' Memorial was officially opened in 1960 to commemorate Turkish soldiers who fought in the Gallipoli campaign. The AFG was officially launched on 7 March 2000 at Parliament House in Canberra for the INTERFET welcome home parade. Ceremonial events have taken the AFG to England, Turkey, Greece, South Korea, Singapore and France. To date, AFG duties have included, among others, Anzac Day support at Gallipoli and Villers-Bretonneaux, support to Greece and Crete commemoration services, support to the Korean War armistice 50th anniversary, support to the 60th anniversary of the fall of Singapore, Royal Guards and House Guards at Buckingham Palace, St James Palace and the Tower of London." id="7407859414" latitude="0" license="1" longitude="0" nbComments="0" rank="135" tags="ceremony triservice gallipoli gallipolipenninsula turkey tur nato otan soldier soldado marine fuzileiro mp “militarypolice” guard swat seal ranger sniper legionary militian sailor airman seaman seabees uniform helmet infantary cavalary fuzil rifle carabine gun pistol exército army division brigade battalion company platoon navy “airforce” legion ak47 m16 “fnfal” hk g36 famas colt beretta taurus coturno farda grenade granada hezbollah militia guerrilla warrior fighter combatantparatrooper mercenary armored blindado shield mateus272425" title="MIL-AUSTRALIAN-ADF_20100424adf8248214_349.JPG" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/7139/7407859414_fa6afbf48e_b.jpg" username="MATEUS_27:24&amp;25" views="105" />
