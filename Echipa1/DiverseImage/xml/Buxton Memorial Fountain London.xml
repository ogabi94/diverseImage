<photo  date_taken="2009-05-20 09:44:00" description="The Buxton Memorial Fountain is a memorial and drinking fountain in London, the United Kingdom, that commemorates the emancipation of slaves in the British Empire in 1834. It was commissioned by Charles Buxton MP, and was dedicated to his father Thomas Fowell Buxton along with William Wilberforce, Thomas Clarkson, Thomas Babington Macaulay, Henry Brougham and Stephen Lushington, all of whom were involved in the abolition. It was designed by Gothic architect Samuel Sanders Teulon (1812–1873) in 1865 coincidently with the passing of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which effectively ended the western slave-trade. It was originally constructed in Parliament Square, erected at a cost of £1,200. As part of the postwar redesign of the square it was removed in 1949 and not reinstated in its present position in Victoria Tower Gardens until 1957. There were eight decorative figures of British rulers on it, but four were stolen in 1960 and four in 1971. They were replaced by fibreglass figures in 1980. By 2005 these were missing, and the fountain was no longer working. Between autumn 2006 and February 2007 restoration works were carried out. The restored fountain was unveiled on 27 March 2007 as part of the commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the act to abolish the slave trade." id="5647359145" latitude="51.497542" license="6" longitude="-0.124905" nbComments="0" rank="7" tags="london england uk briton holiday travel spring canon cold march building architecture" title="Buxton Memorial Fountain - (Day 9 Holiday 2011)" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/5145/5647359145_5e7913b79d_b.jpg" username="Matthew Kenwrick" views="118" />

<photo  date_taken="2010-07-03 01:22:19" description="The Buxton Memorial Fountain is a memorial and drinking fountain in London, the United Kingdom, that commemorates the emancipation of slaves in the British Empire in 1834. It was commissioned by Charles Buxton MP, and was dedicated to his father Thomas Fowell Buxton along with William Wilberforce, Thomas Clarkson, Thomas Babington Macaulay, Henry Brougham and Stephen Lushington, all of whom were involved in the abolition. It was designed by Gothic architect Samuel Sanders Teulon (1812–1873) in 1865 coincidently with the passing of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which effectively ended the western slave-trade. It was originally constructed in Parliament Square, erected at a cost of £1,200. As part of the postwar redesign of the square it was removed in 1949 and not reinstated in its present position in Victoria Tower Gardens until 1957.] There were eight decorative figures of British rulers on it, but four were stolen in 1960 and four in 1971. They were replaced by fibreglass figures in 1980. By 2005 these were missing, and the fountain was no longer working. Between autumn 2006 and February 2007 restoration works were carried out. The restored fountain was unveiled on 27 March 2007 as part of the commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the act to abolish the slave trade. A memorial plaque commemorating the 150th anniversary of the Anti-Slavery Society was added in 1989." id="4756885849" latitude="51.496347" license="4" longitude="-0.124711" nbComments="0" rank="37" tags="london england unitedkingdom buxtonmemorial memorial park victoriatowergardens" title="The Buxton Memorial" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/4121/4756885849_6d6a3d7bf3_b.jpg" username="Accidental Hedonist" views="123" />

Parliament Square is a square outside the north-western end of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/300146847/&quot;&gt;Palace of Westminster&lt;/a&gt;. It was laid out in 1868 by Sir Charles Barry in order to open up the space around the Palace and improve traffic flow, and featured London's first traffic signals. Its original features included the Buxton Memorial Fountain, which was removed in 1940 and placed in its present position in nearby Victoria Tower Gardens in 1957. In 1950 the square was redesigned by George Grey Wornum. The east side of the Square, lying opposite one of the key entrances to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/300150850/&quot;&gt;Palace of Westminster&lt;/a&gt;, has historically been a common site of protest against government action or inaction.

<photo  date_taken="2006-11-09 11:40:13" description="The Parliament Square statue, The Palmsterson, erected in 1869 by Pre-Raphaelite sculptor Thomas Woolner, is perhaps the most important figure in the square in terms of sculptural interest. The figure is naturalistic in pose with Lord Palmerston's hand held out as if in conversation. Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston, (1784 – 1865) was a British statesman who served twice as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in the mid-19th century. He was in government office almost continuously from 1807 until his death in 1865, beginning his parliamentary career as a Tory and concluding it as a Liberal. He is best remembered for his direction of British foreign policy through a period when the United Kingdom was at the height of its power, serving terms as both Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister. British born Woolner (1825-1892) was both sculptor and poet, and a founding member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. Woolner trained with the sculptor William Behnes, exhibiting work at the Royal Academy from 1843.
