<photo  date_taken="2011-11-29 16:10:47" description="5149. Arriving in Sydney on March 11, 1953, HMAS VENGEANCE went into a three months refit at Garden Island. Emerging in June to embark her Hawker Sea Fury and Fairey Firefly squadrons, along with Bristol Sycamore 171 helicopters, at Jervis Bay, VENGEANCE became an operational unit of the RAN for the first time. We believe the deck sign above was made as a way of formally introducing the loaned RN carrier to the RAN Fleet and to the Australian public in the latter part of that year. It was possibly taken when- after working up - VENGEANCE engaged in well-photographed exercises with HMAS SYDNEY [III] and HMAS ANZAC [II] in the Fleet Exercise area in Hervey Bay, Queensland at in September-October that year [1953]. It was the first time the RAN had operated two carriers together in its own right, and resulted in a number of widely-published public relations images. The Photostream has shown several. They include: Pic NO. 21, here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/41311545@N05/3807880035/&quot;&gt;www.flickr.com/photos/41311545@N05/3807880035/&lt;/a&gt; Pic NO. 1361, here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/41311545@N05/4441644213/&quot;&gt;www.flickr.com/photos/41311545@N05/4441644213/&lt;/a&gt; And Pic NO. 2589, here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/41311545@N05/4843802848/&quot;&gt;www.flickr.com/photos/41311545@N05/4843802848/&lt;/a&gt; While the deck sign image itself has been very widely published - it is perhaps the most representative image of VENGEANCE's Australian service - the dating, location and the occasion appeared to have become lost. We'd like to acknowledge the extensive efforts made on the Photostream's behalf by Contributor Kim Dunstan and his friends in the Fleet Air Arm Association of Australia [FAAAA] - in particular John 'Blue' Harrison and Richard Kenderdine - in pinning down the historical context of the photo. John combed the VENGEANCE Reports of Proceedings at the Australian War Memorial on our behalf, and also traced the family of the late Richard Droughton, a Writer on HMAS VENGEANCE, who had provided a copy of the image to Lt Vince Fazio for his book 'RAN Aircraft Carriers.' After Kim had sent a copy of the image to the FAAA's 'Slipstream' magazine, Richard combed the flight logs of his late father Lt. [O] Leonard Kenderdine, who had left a similar image in his colllection, and undertook a number of flight photography assignments from VENGEANCE. Many thanks to all for these efforts. Photo: RAN, it appeared on the RAN Seapower Centre's history webpage for HMAS VENGEANCE, also in Vincent Fazio's book 'RAN Aircraft Carriers' [Naval Historical Society of Australia, Sydney 1997], photo section, credited to the Collection of Ralph Droughton, a writer who had served on VENGEANCE. The photo also appeared in Ross Gillett's 'Warships of Australia' [Rigby Australia, 1977] p131; in Jonathan Nally's 'Aircraft Carriers and Squadrons of the Royal Australian Navy' [Topmill, Sydney] p13; and a number of other sources." id="6423128833" latitude="0" license="1" longitude="0" nbComments="2" rank="23" tags="" title="Sept-Oct. 1953: HMAS VENGEANCE announces herself to the RAN and Australian public - Ralph Droughton Collection." url_b="http://static.flickr.com/7153/6423128833_fb4c14a389_b.jpg" username="Kookaburra2011" views="604" />
<photo  date_taken="2011-02-23 15:51:00" description="4599. The 5,400 ton Town Class cruiser HMAS MELBOURNE [I] is seen here drydock at Portsmouth, England, in an image dated in Australian War Memorial records as September 1916. If the date is correct that would be immediately after she and sister ship HMAS SYDNEY [I] had arrived from the West Indies Station to join the Royal Navy's Grand Fleet on September 7. Both ships imediately went into brief refits then , during which they each had a 3-inch AA gun mounting fitted on a bandstand between their aft funnel and mainmasts. Our concern with the date is that there appears to be an aircraft platform fitted here over MELBOURNE's forward 6-inch gun mount, and she and SYDNEY did not receive her revolving aircraft platforms until November 1917. If it is an aircraft platform then this is a photo afflicated by mis-identifications or mis-dating. The RAN Heritage Collection has it listed as HMAS ADELAIDE [I] at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, Sydney - which it isn't. The Australian War Memorial's descriptive notes accompanying the image resolve nothing on the date, but they say this: '....The Australian light cruiser HMAS MELBOURNE [I] in dry dock. HMAS MELBOURNE was the first cruiser completed and launched for the RAN. With HMAS AUSTRALIA [I] she was present when Samoa was captured from the Germans on 30 August 1914; she landed a force that captured Nauru on 9 September 1914. In November 1914 she was one of the escort for the first Anzac convoy from Australia to the Middle East. With HMAS SYDNEY [I] she transferred to the Royal Navy's Grand Fleet in August 1916; subsequently she engaged in duties that included North Sea patrols, anti submarine sweeps, convoy escorts and so on. She was present when the German High Seas Fleet surrendered in November 1918...' . IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IN 'COM MENTS: From Les Roberts According to a Naval Historical Society booklet : 'A Short History of the Cruiser HMAS MELBOURNE 1913-1928&amp;quot;, MELBOURNE was fitted with an aircraft platform in March 1918, but did not embark an aircraft (Sopwith &amp;quot;Ship's Camel&amp;quot;) for flying operations until 10 May 1918. Both she and SYDNEY carried a Sopwith Camel on a revolving platform during the surrender of the German High Seas Fleet on 21 November 1918. These platforms remained onboard MELBOURNE and SYDNEY after the Armistice, even though the aircraft were removed. MELBOURNE returned to Portsmouth on 30 November 1918 for a refit to repair defects in her main circulator and renew boiler tubes. The history does not mention any other docking in Portsmouth between aircraft embarkation and 30 November 1918, so presumably this photograph was taken during the November 1918 docking before her aircraft was landed. Thanks Les, we're accepting that Nov-30-Dec. refit as most probable.

<photo  date_taken="2010-12-31 18:50:29" description="This evening we went to the annual New Years Eve fireworks at Belmore Basin in Wollongong. I was hoping to get some nice shots of the fireworks with my new (since last year) camera, and the new (since Christmas) tripod. A quick check of what I did take shows that I need to have a look at how I took the pictures; I got a better set last year using a compact camera, hand-held. And this rather average shadow shot see the end of another year of self-portraits. Last year I said &amp;quot;That's it, no more 365 Days for me.&amp;quot; And I stayed true to that; I dropped out of the group and stopped identifying pictures as being part of '365 Days'. But I carried on taking a self-portrait every day. My reasoning was simple - I didn't want to be seen to fail. At the beginning of last year I didn't know if I could see another full year of self-portraits through and, based on the last couple of months, I was right. I've really lost the drive to do it, and it's only been the thought that I was close to the end anyway that's kept me going. So I didn't see any point in committing to a formal 365 Days project that I knew I probably wouldn't complete. I would carry on taking a picture every day but, if I stopped, that would be it. No fuss, bother or failure of a project. The self-portraits would just stop. Of course, as it is, I've managed another full year - Year 4, for those keeping count. In the next few days I hope to retro-fit them into my 365 Days project, and sort out the tagging and so forth. Until then, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/kaptainkobold/sets/72157623903521449/&quot;&gt;this set&lt;/a&gt; has all of them, ordered by Interestingness. Once again, I want to thank the rest of you for comments, support and inspiration. The idea that someone, somewhere found a particular picture fun, or inspiring, is really what keeps this kind of project going. So what have I been up to this year? Well, we've seen more of Tranzilla, and bunny ears have featured as well. My Lego alter-ego has made it into a number of shots (and proved popular when he's done so), and so has my other alter-ago, Rachel. Catherine and the children have featured from time to time, but so have my parents, local cafe-owner Leo, Ann McLeod and (via the magic of Photoshop) Pikespice. I've done tributes to 'Star Wars', 'Amelie', Lady GaGa (so help me), Crystal Castles, Rush, Muse, Sigur Ros, Pink Floyd and Henri Cartier-Bresson. It's been a busy year. On to the pictures themselves. One thing I have done every year is work out my geographical extreme - Most Northerly picture, etc. As with last year, all pictures were taken in Australia and, with a couple of exceptions, within New South Wales: Most Northerly - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/kaptainkobold/4893075075/&quot;&gt;August 15th&lt;/a&gt; (Sydney Aquarium) Most Southerly - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/kaptainkobold/4303564188&quot;&gt;January 23rd&lt;/a&gt; - (War Memorial, Canberra) Most Easterly - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/kaptainkobold/4256320272&quot;&gt;January 8th&lt;/a&gt; (ANZAC Memorial,Sydney) Most Westerly - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/kaptainkobold/4303607510&quot;&gt;January 24th&lt;/a&gt; (National Botanical Gardens, Canberra) So, two war memorials, and all shots either in Canberra or Sydney. I normally do popularity stats, but one picture has them all - it's currently the Most Interesting and it has the Most Views, Most Comments and Most Favourites: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/kaptainkobold/4834066170&quot;&gt;July 27th: Caught Photographer&lt;/a&gt;. I'm please in a way; I enjoyed putting that picture together, although the original artist had done much of the work for me :) Scout tells me that 16 of this year's pictures made Explore, 10 of them in a three-month run from July to September. The Donkey must have been asleep or something. Finally, my personal favourites: 'Amelie' on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/kaptainkobold/4870633229&quot;&gt;August 8th&lt;/a&gt;, a picture I like so much that it sometimes features as my Facebook profile picture.

<photo  date_taken="2011-09-17 16:28:58" description="St. Michael's and All Angels Church Stage 1 of a private project, to make and install stained glass windows in the historic church of St Michael and All Angels in Sandakan, Borneo (Sabah) has been completed. The world class, heritage windows are a memorial to Australian and British prisoners of war who died in Sabah - at Sandakan, Ranau or on the death marches - during 1942-1945, and a thanksgiving to the local people who risked, and gave, their lives to help them. A total of 2428 POWs (of whom 1787 were Australian) died at Sandakan or on one of the infamous death marches to Ranau, the bulk of them in 1945, sixty years ago. Only six Australians who escaped, survived. All 641 British POWs perished. This is the first time Australians from all states have had the opportunity to participate in such a project or to show their gratitude to the people of Sabah, many of whom were tortured or imprisoned for trying to help the prisoners. Eight were executed by firing squad. How many others died is impossible to assess. Many of the prisoners, who were transferred from Singapore by ship, spent the night in the church before marching to the Sandakan compound, 12 kilometres away. Built in the late 1890s from local stone, in the style of a cathedral, St Michael’s is one of only four buildings to survive World War II. All, interestingly, were places of worship - two small Chinese temples, and the town mosque. The idea to create a memorial window was conceived in 2003, during a trip to Sandakan, where I conduct an Anzac Day service with a small group of POW relatives each year. I approached the Rector to discuss my idea and, as a result, the church authorities made available the entire, tri-panelled west window. Over five metres in height, it dominates the main entrance. Response to the project from relatives of the prisoners and other caring people was so great (over $100,000 donated) that it was possible to commission the west window, and three more below, and to create a beautiful POW Chapel in the church. Philip Handel, a well-known Sydney artisan who has spent a life-time designing and making stained glass windows for gothic-style churches, came out of retirement to undertake the project. He used only hand-blown, antique French glass of the highest quality, and which he had not seen in Australia for twenty years. Using this exquisite glass as his basis, he then began creating his masterpiece. Coincidentally, the main window consists of 2,500 pieces - one piece for each POW. Each piece of glass, after Handel had added the detail he required to create his design, was fired in a special kiln, up to three times, depending on the depth of detail required. The design of all four windows is integrated. The main window is spread across the three panels, or lights. Various shades of blue on the outer border represent the oceans which link the three nations. The subject for the upper, or memorial section, is from the Acts of the Apostles, Chapter 12, depicting a shining angel backed by ruby-coloured, spiralling shapes suggesting movement, and enclosed by a rainbow-hued circle – a symbol of peace and hope for the future. Below, in a prison cell, sits St Peter, who is under sentence of death. He is amazed at the awesome sight and incredulous at the miraculous loosening of his chains, and his subsequent deliverance which the Roman guards are unable to prevent. This scene is a reminder of the Almighty’s power to free the spirit of mankind from evil and oppression. The text, ‘By the strength of your arm, preserve those condemned to die’, reinforces this message. Above the angel, at the top of the central arch, sprays of wattle surround the floral emblems of the Australian states from which the men enlisted. The orange and yellow hues in the centre represent the colours of the outback and the setting sun; the purple tones, the mountain ranges. The lower section of the window features the well-known parable, The Good Samaritan. This story, which teaches compassion between strangers, typifies the spirit of mateship which sustained the prisoners until the end, and exemplifies the compassion of local people towards strangers in need of help and comfort during many dark days. Included in this setting is a representation of The Big Tree - a mengarris and a prominent landmark at the infamous Sandakan POW Camp. Another coloured spectrum, echoing the rainbow theme, frames the figures and the whole picture is encompassed with the flowers of Australia, Britain and Sabah, united by their wartime experience. The focus words Endurance, Honour, Compassion, Courage and Sacrifice, describe the triumph of the spirit and will over flesh – the purpose of the memorial. Below the main window are a large arched window over the west door, featuring a brilliantly coloured Christian cross, and two much smaller windows to either side – an angel representing Peace and another representing Eternity. The centre piece of the chapel, directly below the main window and incorporating the small angel windows, is a finely crafted, altar-like Table of Honour, with polished granite top, on which are inscribed the words ‘For there are deeds that should not pass away, And names that must not be forgotten.’ Over the granite is a glass case, containing the Roll of Honour, inscribed with the names of all our POWs, and local people who died or helped, and the Book of Special Remembrance, containing the names of all donors, along with the names of people they are jointly or individually honouring, and any special inscription. The books, hand-bound in burgundy, Moroccan leather and hand tooled in gold, are composed of archival parchment guaranteed to last 500 years. Each week, a new page will be turned. Resting on the blank left-hand page of each book, as a paper-weight, is a life-size pewter gum leaf, with a cluster of gum nuts. Around the walls of the chapel are regimental plaques, donated by associations and individuals and a hand-made pulpit banner, donated by the family of Padre McLiver, an Australian army officer, who used it at his services, following the liberation of Borneo in 1945, and which we had framed. The breathtakingly beautiful windows and the chapel were dedicated at 4 pm on Anzac Eve. The 130 Australians and four British present, along with 50 family members of local people being honoured, knew they were about to witness something very special when the opening notes of the Trumpet Voluntary heralded a grand procession of a forty-voice choir dressed in brand-new robes, colour parties carrying the flags of Australia, Britain, Sabah and Malaysia (the Australian flag escorted by an Australian soldier whose grandfather had died at Sandakan) and senior Anglican clergy, headed by the Archbishop of South-East Asia Province, Datuk Yong Ping Chung, all clad in gorgeous cream, gold and red regalia. The four windows, draped in burgundy silk shot with gold, were unveiled and dedicated, one by one, with various people from the POW families, and local people, assisting the Archbishop. With the afternoon sun lighting up the three lower windows in spectacular fashion, the strains of the Hallelujah Chorus filled the church and the final curtain rose slowly, to reveal a window of such stunning and awesome magnificence that every person present, some 300 all told, stopped clapping and stood in rapt silence, absolutely transfixed. Tears poured down almost every cheek, including those of cameramen and journalists. I have never experienced anything like it. The Windows of Remembrance must surely be Philip Handel’s finest work. The following day, at 4 pm, there was an ‘official opening’ by the Deputy Chief Minister and Sabah’s Minister for Tourism, at a most joyous and moving celebration, a wonderful community event at which children danced and balloons were released. The Minister, along with representatives of the Australian and British High Commissions and other dignitaries, entered the church, where they gazed in wonderment as the Windows were revealed one at a time, as on the previous day. However, it was not until later, at the reception attended by the VIPs and our donors, that I realised how much our windows meant to the wider community. There was total silence and a good many more tears when a tiny Chinese lady presented me with a beautiful oil painting of Mt Kinabalu, where local legend says the spirits of the dead ascend, to express her gratitude for honouring the local people in the Windows of Remembrance. Aged 82, she had travelled by public bus with her son, as her interpreter, all the way from Kota Kinabalu – a journey of seven hours – to meet me. The many people who have expressed their disappointment at having missed out on Stage 1 are now invited to participate in Stage 2 - to install stained glass in the two remaining major windows, over the north and south doors. Our prisoners left us a wonderful legacy - goodwill and friendship between nations, forged by our prisoners with the people of Sabah in a time of great adversity. We will endorse this legacy by having friendship and love for our fellow man as our focus for Stage 2. Here is your chance to be part of something very special. If you would like to ensure that the precious legacy of our POWs is passed to successive generations; if you would like to transform the tragedy and grief of Sandakan into something beautiful and uplifting, a testimony to the triumph of good over evil and a source of wonder, awe and a joy for hundreds of years to come, please contact me. Any excess funds will be used to set up a maintenance fund for all the stained glass and to support the Sandakan Memorial Scholarship Scheme.

<photo  date_taken="2011-09-17 16:31:58" description="St. Michael's and All Angels Church Stage 1 of a private project, to make and install stained glass windows in the historic church of St Michael and All Angels in Sandakan, Borneo (Sabah) has been completed. The world class, heritage windows are a memorial to Australian and British prisoners of war who died in Sabah - at Sandakan, Ranau or on the death marches - during 1942-1945, and a thanksgiving to the local people who risked, and gave, their lives to help them. A total of 2428 POWs (of whom 1787 were Australian) died at Sandakan or on one of the infamous death marches to Ranau, the bulk of them in 1945, sixty years ago. Only six Australians who escaped, survived. All 641 British POWs perished. This is the first time Australians from all states have had the opportunity to participate in such a project or to show their gratitude to the people of Sabah, many of whom were tortured or imprisoned for trying to help the prisoners. Eight were executed by firing squad. How many others died is impossible to assess. Many of the prisoners, who were transferred from Singapore by ship, spent the night in the church before marching to the Sandakan compound, 12 kilometres away. Built in the late 1890s from local stone, in the style of a cathedral, St Michael’s is one of only four buildings to survive World War II. All, interestingly, were places of worship - two small Chinese temples, and the town mosque. The idea to create a memorial window was conceived in 2003, during a trip to Sandakan, where I conduct an Anzac Day service with a small group of POW relatives each year. I approached the Rector to discuss my idea and, as a result, the church authorities made available the entire, tri-panelled west window. Over five metres in height, it dominates the main entrance. Response to the project from relatives of the prisoners and other caring people was so great (over $100,000 donated) that it was possible to commission the west window, and three more below, and to create a beautiful POW Chapel in the church. Philip Handel, a well-known Sydney artisan who has spent a life-time designing and making stained glass windows for gothic-style churches, came out of retirement to undertake the project. He used only hand-blown, antique French glass of the highest quality, and which he had not seen in Australia for twenty years. Using this exquisite glass as his basis, he then began creating his masterpiece. Coincidentally, the main window consists of 2,500 pieces - one piece for each POW. Each piece of glass, after Handel had added the detail he required to create his design, was fired in a special kiln, up to three times, depending on the depth of detail required. The design of all four windows is integrated. The main window is spread across the three panels, or lights. Various shades of blue on the outer border represent the oceans which link the three nations. The subject for the upper, or memorial section, is from the Acts of the Apostles, Chapter 12, depicting a shining angel backed by ruby-coloured, spiralling shapes suggesting movement, and enclosed by a rainbow-hued circle – a symbol of peace and hope for the future. Below, in a prison cell, sits St Peter, who is under sentence of death. He is amazed at the awesome sight and incredulous at the miraculous loosening of his chains, and his subsequent deliverance which the Roman guards are unable to prevent. This scene is a reminder of the Almighty’s power to free the spirit of mankind from evil and oppression. The text, ‘By the strength of your arm, preserve those condemned to die’, reinforces this message. Above the angel, at the top of the central arch, sprays of wattle surround the floral emblems of the Australian states from which the men enlisted. The orange and yellow hues in the centre represent the colours of the outback and the setting sun; the purple tones, the mountain ranges. The lower section of the window features the well-known parable, The Good Samaritan. This story, which teaches compassion between strangers, typifies the spirit of mateship which sustained the prisoners until the end, and exemplifies the compassion of local people towards strangers in need of help and comfort during many dark days. Included in this setting is a representation of The Big Tree - a mengarris and a prominent landmark at the infamous Sandakan POW Camp. Another coloured spectrum, echoing the rainbow theme, frames the figures and the whole picture is encompassed with the flowers of Australia, Britain and Sabah, united by their wartime experience. The focus words Endurance, Honour, Compassion, Courage and Sacrifice, describe the triumph of the spirit and will over flesh – the purpose of the memorial. Below the main window are a large arched window over the west door, featuring a brilliantly coloured Christian cross, and two much smaller windows to either side – an angel representing Peace and another representing Eternity. The centre piece of the chapel, directly below the main window and incorporating the small angel windows, is a finely crafted, altar-like Table of Honour, with polished granite top, on which are inscribed the words ‘For there are deeds that should not pass away, And names that must not be forgotten.’ Over the granite is a glass case, containing the Roll of Honour, inscribed with the names of all our POWs, and local people who died or helped, and the Book of Special Remembrance, containing the names of all donors, along with the names of people they are jointly or individually honouring, and any special inscription. The books, hand-bound in burgundy, Moroccan leather and hand tooled in gold, are composed of archival parchment guaranteed to last 500 years. Each week, a new page will be turned. Resting on the blank left-hand page of each book, as a paper-weight, is a life-size pewter gum leaf, with a cluster of gum nuts. Around the walls of the chapel are regimental plaques, donated by associations and individuals and a hand-made pulpit banner, donated by the family of Padre McLiver, an Australian army officer, who used it at his services, following the liberation of Borneo in 1945, and which we had framed. The breathtakingly beautiful windows and the chapel were dedicated at 4 pm on Anzac Eve. The 130 Australians and four British present, along with 50 family members of local people being honoured, knew they were about to witness something very special when the opening notes of the Trumpet Voluntary heralded a grand procession of a forty-voice choir dressed in brand-new robes, colour parties carrying the flags of Australia, Britain, Sabah and Malaysia (the Australian flag escorted by an Australian soldier whose grandfather had died at Sandakan) and senior Anglican clergy, headed by the Archbishop of South-East Asia Province, Datuk Yong Ping Chung, all clad in gorgeous cream, gold and red regalia. The four windows, draped in burgundy silk shot with gold, were unveiled and dedicated, one by one, with various people from the POW families, and local people, assisting the Archbishop. With the afternoon sun lighting up the three lower windows in spectacular fashion, the strains of the Hallelujah Chorus filled the church and the final curtain rose slowly, to reveal a window of such stunning and awesome magnificence that every person present, some 300 all told, stopped clapping and stood in rapt silence, absolutely transfixed. Tears poured down almost every cheek, including those of cameramen and journalists. I have never experienced anything like it. The Windows of Remembrance must surely be Philip Handel’s finest work. The following day, at 4 pm, there was an ‘official opening’ by the Deputy Chief Minister and Sabah’s Minister for Tourism, at a most joyous and moving celebration, a wonderful community event at which children danced and balloons were released. The Minister, along with representatives of the Australian and British High Commissions and other dignitaries, entered the church, where they gazed in wonderment as the Windows were revealed one at a time, as on the previous day. However, it was not until later, at the reception attended by the VIPs and our donors, that I realised how much our windows meant to the wider community. There was total silence and a good many more tears when a tiny Chinese lady presented me with a beautiful oil painting of Mt Kinabalu, where local legend says the spirits of the dead ascend, to express her gratitude for honouring the local people in the Windows of Remembrance. Aged 82, she had travelled by public bus with her son, as her interpreter, all the way from Kota Kinabalu – a journey of seven hours – to meet me.

Designed by Bruce Dellit, it was opened in 1934. It contains sculptures by an English-born migrant, Raynor Hoff. His beautiful interior statue called ‘Sacrifice’ depicts a group of three women supporting a dead soldier - the givers of life, weighed down by death. This is often interpreted as a powerful peace symbol, and at the time of building this memorial generated a lot of debate.

Dedicated by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth and the Australian Prime Minister John Howard on November 11, 2003, the design for the memorial features a long, curving wall of West Australian green granite, reflecting the sweep of the Australian landscape. The wall features names of 47 of the battle sites where Australian and British military personnel fought, superimposed upon the names of 24,000 home towns of Australian servicemen and women, many of whom were never to return home. Designed by Sydney architectural firm Tonkin Zulaikha Greer and artist Janet Laurence, it uses water in a cyclical display to create shifting patterns, highlighting different facets of the memorial. An innovative lighting system illuminates the memorial wall by night. The striking design of the memorial brings a touch of the Australian landscape and character to the heart of London, forming the focus for Anzac Day Dawn Services in London and providing a place of pilgrimage for Australians and Britons alike." id="298026739" latitude="51.502197" license="3" longitude="-0.151582" nbComments="1" rank="103" tags="uk unitedkingdom britain greatbritain europe australianwarmemorial memorial wwi wwii worldwar worldwari worldwarii warmemorial granite hydepark hydeparkcorner australian knightsbridge londonist westminster london england" title="UK - London - Knightsbridge:  Hyde Park Corner - Australian War Memorial" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/114/298026739_702d8f3982_b.jpg" username="wallyg" views="1313" />

This photograph is from the collection of the later-famous WWI official war historian Charles Edwin Woodrow Bean, a former Sydney Morning Herald journalist.

Symbolising the spirit of courage, endurance and sacrifice a lonely soldier lies over a shield and sword. Supporting him are three female figures and an infant representing 'his best beloved' - mother, sister, wife and child. The infant serves also to represent future generations. Sculpted by Rayner Hoff, Australia's most successful public sculptor of the time Engraved forever at ANZAC Cove are these words from Kemal Ataturk, the Commander of the Turkish 19th Division during the Gallipoli Campaign and the first President of the Turkish Republic from 1924-1938: &amp;quot;..........Those heroes that shed their blood and lost their lives. You are now living in the soil of a friendly country therefore rest in peace. There is no difference between the Johnnies and the Mehmets to us where they lie side by side here in this country of ours. You, the mothers, who sent their sons from faraway countries wipe away your tears; your sons are now lying in our bosom and are in peace. After having lost their lives on this land they have become our sons as well..........&amp;quot; I believe this is not only a tribute to those who have lost their lives in the past and those who continue to place theirs at risk on a daily basis, but to the empathy and compassion of Kemal Ataturk.
