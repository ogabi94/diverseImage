<photo  date_taken="2008-10-29 17:18:16" description="Equestrians on the Strand Two equestrian riders, girls on horseback, in low tide reflections on serene Morro Strand State Beach, Morro Bay, CA October 29, 2008. &lt;b&gt;Two equestrian riders, girls on horseback, in low tide reflections on serene Morro Strand State Beach&lt;/b&gt; This is, as of 8/9/2011, my &amp;quot;most interestingness&amp;quot; photo on Flickr. See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/groups/1_most_interestingness_and_why/&quot;&gt;www.flickr.com/groups/1_most_interestingness_and_why/&lt;/a&gt; RE: &amp;quot;Be sure to add a sentence in your description field as to why &lt;b&gt;you&lt;/b&gt; think this photo became so interesting/popular to the Flickr community.&amp;quot; A: &lt;b&gt;&amp;quot;This photo got traction because it is simple - there are no distracting background elements. It looks pretty good in its thumbnail form. Rule of thirds applied gives negative space for the subjects, here on horseback, to ride forward. It tells a little story of people riding horses on a deserted beach at low tide on a foggy day.&amp;quot;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Lesson: Simplicity is best. Don't ruin an image by including irrelevant elements. Point-and-shoots may yield a winning photo. This was taken with a Canon PowerShot SD950 IS, and is one of my most popular images at Flickr with 67,000 views and 950 favs, despite being intentionally over-processed.&lt;/b&gt; To use this photo, see the access, attribution, and commenting recommendations at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/people/mikebaird/#credit&quot;&gt;www.flickr.com/people/mikebaird/#credit&lt;/a&gt; - Please add comments/notes/tags to add to or correct information, identification, etc. &lt;i&gt;Please, no comments or invites with images, multiple invites, award levels, flashing icons, or award/post rules. &lt;/i&gt; Critique invited. 02 Dec 2009 Featured front-page Photo at &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.tssphoto.com/index.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;TSSPhoto&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Surprisingly, this snapshot taken with a just a pocket Canon PowerShot SD950 IS is amongst &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/mikebaird/sets/72157621825319127/&quot;&gt;my most-viewed photos on Flickr&lt;/a&gt; (11/09 ~30K views) and has been over-processed with artificial gradients and tone - Thanks to all for the kind comments.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;Two equestrian riders, girls on horseback, in quite a foggy day, with low tide reflections at sunset on Morro Strand State Beach 29 Oct. 2008&lt;/b&gt;. Michael &amp;quot;Mike&amp;quot; L. Baird Canon SD950 point-and-shoot snapshot. This photo has some &amp;quot;way overdone&amp;quot; Lightroom 2 gradient treatments applied: gold bottom-to -center; blue top-to-center toning. Serene mood. Also characteristic of Montana de Oro area to the south. &lt;b&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://flickr.com/groups/821430@N20&quot;&gt;Digital 100 Examples lesson&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;More can be less.&amp;quot;&lt;/b&gt; Sometimes the better photo is the one with fewer elements and/or a simple background or context into which a focus of interest can be composed. Notice the rule-of-thirds at play here as well, and use of the leading space to the right to lessen tension for the riders moving in that direction. 19 April 2009 Awarded #2 in &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/groups/share_your_best_with_the_world/discuss/72157603189999013/#comment72157616974375025&quot;&gt;Share Your Best with the World &amp;quot;reflections&amp;quot; contest&lt;/a&gt;. 24 Nov. 2008 Used in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/groups/textures_only/discuss/72157609923530873/&quot;&gt;a Creative Commons competition&lt;/a&gt;, and by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/spiritual_marketplace/3057516822/&quot;&gt;Eddi in Germany&lt;/a&gt;!

<photo  date_taken="2008-07-17 00:28:12" description="About three months ago, my sister discovered this beautiful 1955 Dodge Jobline pick-up truck in a local Charleston newspaper. Knowing how much I'd always dreamed of owning a 1950's red pick-up, she rang to tell me about the listing and I located it online. We talked about how beautiful it was and of all the things we'd love to do with the truck, but the price was simply too high and over time, we soon forgot about her. Then, about two weeks ago, our Granny passed away and I found myself back in S.C. for her burial. One day shortly after, with emotions still at an all-time high, my sister and I decided we would go kayaking where our Granny and Grandpa were born and raised. It would've been a great trip, except none of the weather forecasters had predicted the severe thunderstorms that ensued and we quickly found ourselves in need of alternative plans. What better to do than shop, right? With our trip canceled, we found ourselves riding around Mt. Pleasant with a ridiculously large two-person kayak on our roof and &amp;quot;nothing&amp;quot; to do. I mentioned thinking it would be nice to go back and check out this 1960's “Endless Summer” type canary yellow station wagon we’d passed the day before, so we headed to the garage where it was parked. After perusing a wide array of vintage vehicles, we made out way to the garage and struck up a conversation with the mechanics. We inquired about some of the vintage vehicles and mentioned we’d found a red 1950’s red pick-up a few months back and asked if they’d ever seen one. They mentioned knowing of both a black and a white 1950's truck, but no red one. As the conversation neared the ½ hour mark, one of the mechanics remembered he’d seen a red 1950’s pick-up parked at a law firm not far from the shop. As soon as he said this I thought (and my sister claims I said out loud), “That’s it!”. After getting a few other places / people’s names who might know where to find a 1950’s pick-up, we took our chances and headed to see the truck the mechanic had mentioned seeing &amp;quot;a while back&amp;quot;. We had nothing to lose by looking. As soon as we saw the vehicle and drove around the back-end, I knew it was the same one my sister had found three months prior. On the driver’s door window hung a sign advertising a slashed price and a phone number. After taking some photos and checking out the vehicle, my sister rang the listed number. We’d both just assumed the truck belonged to a man, so when a woman answered, she was surprised. After speaking for a few minutes, it became clear the voice at the other end was not going to “hand the phone over” (to a man). So, my sister asked, &amp;quot;Are you the owner?&amp;quot;, to which the woman replied, &amp;quot;Yes!&amp;quot;. Needless to say, I think we were all a little surprised. The owner - Christine - explained she'd moved to Charleston from NYC to get into the bakery business and had bought the truck to &amp;quot;pick up men&amp;quot; – yes, that’s why she’d gotten it. At this juncture, my sister looked like she'd seen a ghost. There were several reasons for this &amp;quot;ook&amp;quot;. One being, she’d been born in NY and two, her sister (that'd be me) currently lives there. Thirdly, she'd been trying to figure out how to transition out of a career in radio and was thinking of starting a baking business! I'm not kidding. When she asked Christine if owning the truck had indeed helped her meet any men, she said it hadn't, but that the truck had been rented quite a few times for photo shoots and commercials. Gears in our heads quickly began turning. And Christine was so happy that women were calling about the truck because she specifically wanted to sell the truck to a female. She told us to go into the offices and get the keys to go for a spin. She’d also mentioned the mechanic who’d worked on the truck was close by and told us where to find his garage. After going in and speaking with a lovely woman who had some problem locating the keys, we went back outside to wait. After a few minutes, the keys arrived and the girl mentioned if we could wait, that the mechanic who’d worked on the vehicle would be coming by to pick both she and her Mum in a few minutes. Huh? Why?!? Because the mechanic was her father! When we heard this, it was like a bolt of lightening had struck. How was it possible the mechanic we’d just been told about and whom we were going to go visit would be coming to us? Things were just getting too weird, so, of course, we waited. It seemed kizmit was taking over at this juncture. It had been a while since I’d driven a standard, though it’s been my main transmission for the majority of my driving years, so I wasn’t too worried. And, my sister had learned how to drive a standard shift on a tractor on someone’s farm, so between the two of us, we thought we’d be okay. Not long after, the mechanic arrived. If seemed the truck hadn’t been started in a while, so he had to jump-start her and we all piled in. He took us to a nearby car park and we drove around back to an empty area. My sister decided to go first and we all had a really good laugh. Next, it was my turn and after the mechanic properly explained the H-gear pattern, I did an so-so job with the ½ ton, no power steering, no power breaks slant V6 badass – though this isn’t to say it wasn’t nerve-racking as hell! Not only was she extremely difficult to maneuver, but somehow driving her made one’s hands completely black and at some point, we’d all touched our faces and had black marks all over ourselves and our clothing. We looked like Al Jolsen in his black-face – except, in reverse! After returning to the law firm, we said we’d be back in a few days. We spent a day trying to figure out how we could make getting this truck happen and returned to take (what we’d already named) “Big Red” to a few mechanics shops and restoration experts the following day. Before getting out on crowded main roads, we decided to get some more practice driving the truck and so, after some quick cleaning of the windows and interior, we headed back to that nearby car park. It’s a good thing my sister had learned to drive on a tractor, because on this particular 97degree afternoon, “Big Red” was akin to driving around in a 1/2 ton tractor. Driving Red was roughly the equivalent to taking part in a triathlon in 105 degree temperatures. Because she’s so hard to drive, on one occasion, I had to grab the giant wheel and help my sister make a turn! Yes, it took two of us and we’re both over 5”10, with plenty of muscle. Oh how I was beginning to appreciate power steering! Jerking in-and-out-of all three gears, my sister finally stalled Big Red for a second time - sending us to a halting stop. Sweating and dirty, she screamed out in frustration, “Oh my God, I can't do this! We’re crazy! This is never going to work!”. Searching for the inspirational words an older sibling is supposed to have at the ready, I turned my head and spotted this white big rig parked just beside us and nearly fainted. For, it was a Cardinal line truck with no more than two cardinal emblems – one on the cab and one on the trailer - emblazoned upon it. You see, our Grandfather, who had died when we were very small was a country boy (related to Swamp Fox - yeah!) and his favorite bird was the cardinal. We know anytime one crosses our paths, to pay close attention. Gasping, I directed her attention right toward the “cardinal spotting” and we both nearly lost it. Tears welled up in both our eyes. My sister then took a deep breath and said, “Did you see the pair of cardinals fly past us as we drove back here?”. I hadn't and said so, but quickly grabbed my camera to capture the rig carrying the cardinal message from our Gran. While neither said so, in that moment, I think we both knew we'd buy the 1955 Dodge- even before we took her to get checked out. Can't go against the elders, right? We offered nearly half the original price and Christine accepted. So, if for any reason, you’re in need of a classic 1955 Dodge pick up truck in fire engine red, you know who to contact!

<photo  date_taken="2008-07-30 19:21:20" description="HELP! NYC's public transportation system is in crisis. With fuel prices up and the economy down, public aid for mass transit hasn't kept up, and now the MTA is proposing multiple fare hikes to close the gap. In a few short days, thousands of New Yorkers and Working Family Party supporters have called on the Governor and Mayor to keep public transportation affordable by boosting state and city aid. It worked! Because of the public outcry, both Mayor Bloomberg and Gov. Paterson have called on the agency to solve its budget problems without raising fares - but simple math says train and bus riders will shoulder the burden unless the state and city boost funding for mass transit. We need to keep the pressure on. We can Halt the Hike, but only if we make New York's voice heard: Send your message: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haltthehike.org&quot;&gt;www.haltthehike.org&lt;/a&gt; State funding from Albany for the MTA is lagging far behind what's needed to maintain our aging subway system and meet the challenges of the 21st Century. New York City isn't doing any better: City Hall now contributes just 7% of the cost of keeping the transit system running. With the cost of living going through the roof, working families in New York can't afford a fare hike for the second year in a row. That's why the Working Families Party and NYPIRG's Straphangers' Campaign are teaming up again to fight for adequate funding for New York's public transportation system - the greatest public asset New York owns. It won't be easy, but together we can save public transportation - if we make sure Albany and City Hall hear us loud and clear. Join the call: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haltthehike.org/&quot;&gt;www.haltthehike.org/&lt;/a&gt; FROM: Gene Russianoff, Lead Attorney NYPIRG's Straphangers Campaign AND: Dan Cantor, Executive Director, WFP Help Working Families fight for the little guy!

<photo  date_taken="2012-02-25 16:49:14" description="This remaining piece of the original interior wall decor of the Reid Brothers' 1909 Cliff House was uncovered during a recent renovation. The Cliff House is a restaurant perched on the headlands on the cliffs just north of Ocean Beach at 1090 Point Lobos Avenue. Its current and fifth incarnation features two restaurants, the casual dining Bistro Restaurant and the more formal Sutro's; and its Terrace Room serves a Sunday Brunch buffet. Now part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, operated by the National Park Service, the Cliff House features a gift shop and the Camera Obscura on a deck overlooking the ocean. During its most recent renovation, the Musée Mécanique was moved to Fisherman's Wharf. The first Cliff House was built in 1858 by Samuel Brannan, a prosperous ex-Mormon elder from Maine, using lumber salvaged from a shop that foundered on the basalt cliffs below. The second Cliff house, built for Captain Junius G. Foster, catered mostly to horseback riders and day trippers until the opening of the Point Lobos toll road and eventually Golden Gate Park opened it up. In 1883, the Cliff House was bought by Adolph Sutro, who rebuilt it after it was first damaged by an explosion from an abandoned schooner loaded with dynamite in 1883 and then completely destroyed by a chimney fire in 1894. The replacement, a seven-story Victorian Cheateau opened the same year as his Sutro Baths, pulling in throngs of visitors. The Cliff House survived the 1906 earthquake with little damage but burned to the ground in 1907. Dr. Emma Merritt, Sutro's daughter, commissioned a new neo-classical style building which was completed by 1909. In 1937, George and Leo Whitney purchased the Cliff House, complementing their Playland-at-the-Beach, and extensively remodeled it into an American roadhouse. When the NPS acquired the building in 1977, many of Whitney's additions were removed and it was restored to its 1909 appearance. In 2003, an extensive further renovation added a new two-story wing overlooking the Sutro Bath ruins." id="6969267327" latitude="37.77848" license="3" longitude="-122.513939" nbComments="1" rank="10" tags="thecliffhouse cliffhouse restaurant interiorwalldecoration goldengatenationalrecreationarea ggnra nps nationalparkservice sf sanfrancisco sfist sanfranciscobayarea bayarea california sutrodistrict" title="San Francisco: The Cliff House - Interior Wall decoration from 1909 Cliff House" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/7037/6969267327_14ef147d22_b.jpg" username="wallyg" views="185" />

Typical beach weather is more likely in the late fall or early spring. Seal Rocks is a rock formation island found offshore at the north end of the Ocean Beach.

Her right foot is placed inside the pool, indicating that she is connected to the watery sphere of the emotions.

One of these flasks is made from gold (representing the Sun) and the other of silver (the Moon). Above the naked maiden, seven silver-white stars glow in the sky, and these represent the seven planets of traditional astrology - Saturn, Mars, Jupiter, Sun, Venus, Moon and Mercury - while a larger golden star dominates the heavens. This star represents cosmic energy and has eight points, the number eight signifying the balance of opposing forces. The ground around the pool looks fertile and in the distance we see a mountain, symbolic of the mystic quest. On top of the mountain is a solitary tree, and in this tree sits a scarlet ibis, representing pure thought.

The ruins are still open to the public and are now part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and operated by the National Park Service. When Sutro Baths originally opened to the public on March 14, 1896, they were the world's largest indoor swimming pool establishment. The vast structure filled a small beach inlet below the Cliff House, also owned by Adolph Sutro at the time. The baths offered seven different swimming pools--one fresh water and six salt water, ranging in termperatures. During high tides, water would flow directly into the pools from the nearby ocean, recycling the two million US gallons of water in about an hour. During low tides, a powerful turbine water pump, built inside a cave at sea level, could fill the tanks at a rate of 6,000 US gallons a minute, recycling all the water in five hours. The facility also housed a museum displaying Sutro's large and varied personal collection of artifacts from his travels, an 8,000-seat concert hall, and an ice skating rink.

Its current and fifth incarnation features two restaurants, the casual dining Bistro Restaurant and the more formal Sutro's; and its Terrace Room serves a Sunday Brunch buffet. Now part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, operated by the National Park Service, the Cliff House features a gift shop and the Camera Obscura on a deck overlooking the ocean. During its most recent renovation, the Musée Mécanique was moved to Fisherman's Wharf. The first Cliff House was built in 1858 by Samuel Brannan, a prosperous ex-Mormon elder from Maine, using lumber salvaged from a shop that foundered on the basalt cliffs below. The second Cliff house, built for Captain Junius G. Foster, catered mostly to horseback riders and day trippers until the opening of the Point Lobos toll road and eventually Golden Gate Park opened it up. In 1883, the Cliff House was bought by Adolph Sutro, who rebuilt it after it was first damaged by an explosion from an abandoned schooner loaded with dynamite in 1883 and then completely destroyed by a chimney fire in 1894. The replacement, a seven-story Victorian Cheateau opened the same year as his Sutro Baths, pulling in throngs of visitors. The Cliff House survived the 1906 earthquake with little damage but burned to the ground in 1907. Dr. Emma Merritt, Sutro's daughter, commissioned a new neo-classical style building which was completed by 1909. In 1937, George and Leo Whitney purchased the Cliff House, complementing their Playland-at-the-Beach, and extensively remodeled it into an American roadhouse. When the NPS acquired the building in 1977, many of Whitney's additions were removed and it was restored to its 1909 appearance. In 2003, an extensive further renovation added a new two-story wing overlooking the Sutro Bath ruins." id="6968550311" latitude="37.777916" license="3" longitude="-122.513437" nbComments="0" rank="17" tags="sealrocks cliffhouse oceanbeach beach coast restaurant sf sanfrancisco sfist sanfranciscobayarea bayarea california goldengatenationalrecreationarea ggnra nps nationalparkservice sutrodistrict" title="San Francisco: Ocean Beach, Cliff House, and Seal Rocks" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/7187/6968550311_c1a21d5986_b.jpg" username="wallyg" views="355" />

They were brought to Iceland by the first settlers from Norway, in the late ninth to early tenth centuries. Due to the harsh climate and the lack of vegetation over more than one half of the country, the Icelandic horse had an extremely difficult existence. Only the strongest and the fittest could survive. As a result of a plague in Europe, Iceland quarantined itself for many years. In AD 930 a law was passed to ban the importation of horses and other animals into Iceland to keep out diseases. This had the effect of preserving the purity of the Icelandic horses – they have never been crossbred with other horses and have remained pure for over a thousand years – and they still are! The Icelandic horse has five gaits, among them the magical tölt. The tölt is the speciality of the Icelandic horse. It is a remarkably smooth gait in which the horse moves its feet in the same order as in walk, though more quickly. It is a supremely comfortable gait for the rider, and one that is available at a variety of speeds." id="5639895145" latitude="64.306663" license="1" longitude="-20.311009" nbComments="0" rank="18" tags="2011 iceland icelandichorses thegoldencircle carrots horse horses trip ísland" title="Carrots you say?" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/5225/5639895145_ea3c4ab2fe_b.jpg" username="jonathanpercy" views="184" />

<photo  date_taken="2012-08-03 15:48:39" description="From Wikipedia... The Cliff House is a restaurant perched on the headland above the cliffs just north of Ocean Beach, on the western side of San Francisco, California. It overlooks the site of the former Sutro Baths and is now part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, operated by the National Park Service. On the terrace of the Cliff House is a room-sized camera obscura. Cliff House has had five major incarnations since its beginnings in 1858. That year, Samuel Brannan, a prosperous ex-Mormon elder from Maine, bought for $1,500 the lumber salvaged from a ship that foundered on the basalt cliffs below. With this material he built the first Cliff House. The second Cliff House was built in 1863, and leased to Captain Junius G. Foster[1][2]. It was a long trek from the city and hosted mostly horseback riders, small game hunters or picnickers on day outings. With the opening of the Point Lobos toll road a year later, the Cliff House became successful with the Carriage trade for Sunday travel. Later the builders of the toll road constructed a two mile speedway beside it where well-to-do San Franciscans raced their horses along the way. On weekends, there was little room at the Cliff House hitching racks for tethering the horses for the thousands of rigs. Soon, omnibus, railways and streetcar lines made it to near Lone Mountain where passengers transferred to stagecoach lines to the beach. The growth of Golden Gate Park attracted beach travellers, in search of meals and a look at the sea lions sunning themselves on Seal Rocks just off the cliffs, to visit the area. In 1877, the toll road, now Geary Boulevard, was purchased by the city for around $25,000. In 1883, after a few years of downturn, the Cliff House was bought by Adolph Sutro, who had solved the problems of ventilating and draining the mines of the Comstock Lode and become a multimillionaire. After a few years of quiet management by J.M. Wilkens, the Cliff House was severely damaged by a dynamite explosion when the schooner, Parallel, ran aground on January 16, 1887[3]. The blast was heard a hundred miles away and demolished the entire north wing of the tavern. The building was repaired, but was later completely destroyed on Christmas night 1894 due to a defective flue.[4] Wilkens was unable to save the guest register, which included the signatures of three Presidents and dozens of illustrious world-famous visitors. This incarnation of the Cliff House, with its various extensions, had lasted for 31 years. In 1896, Adolph Sutro built a new Cliff House, a seven story Victorian Chateau, called by some &amp;quot;the Gingerbread Palace&amp;quot;, below his estate on the bluffs of Sutro Heights. This was the same year work began on the famous Sutro Baths in a small cove immediately north of the Restaurant. The baths included six of the largest indoor swimming pools, a museum, a skating rink and other pleasure grounds. Great throngs of San Franciscans arrived on steam trains, bicycles, carts and horse wagons on Sunday excursions. The 1896 Cliff House survived the 1906 earthquake with little damage, but burned to the ground on the evening of September 7, 1907, after existing for only 11 years. Dr. Emma Merritt, Sutro's daughter, commissioned a rebuilding of the restaurant in a neo-classical style that was completed within two years and is the basis of the structure seen today. In 1937, George and Leo Whitney purchased the Cliff House, to complement their Playland-at-the-Beach attraction nearby, and extensively remodelled it into an American roadhouse. In the 1960s, upon the closing of Playland, the Musée Mécanique, a museum of 20th-century penny arcade games, was moved into the basement of the Cliff House.[5] The building was acquired by the National Park Service in 1977 and became part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. In 2003, as part of an extensive renovation, many of Whitney's additions were removed and the building was restored to its 1909 appearance. A new two-story wing was constructed overlooking what were by then the ruins of the Sutro Baths (the Baths were burnt to the ground on June 26, 1966[6]). During the site restoration, the Musée Mécanique was moved to Fisherman's Wharf.[5] More than thirty ships have been pounded to pieces on the southern shore of the Golden Gate below the Cliff House. The area immediately around Cliff House is part of the setting of Jack London's novel The Scarlet Plague (1912).[7] Modern Cliff House Cliff House in background, past Sutro Bath Ruins, 2008 When the Cliff House became part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area in 1977, the National Park Service contracted with Dan and Mary Hountalas as official concessionaires of the property. The NPS renewed its contract with the Hountalas family, under the name Peanut Wagon, in 1998.[8] Peanut Wagon continues to manage Cliff House operations and worked with the Park Service for the extensive site restoration that was completed in 2004. The Cliff House features two restaurants, the casual dining Bistro Restaurant and the more formal Sutro's. Additionally, the Terrace Room serves a Sunday Brunch buffet. There is a gift shop in the building, and the historic Camera Obscura is on a deck overlooking the ocean." id="7706489144" latitude="0" license="3" longitude="0" nbComments="0" rank="22" tags="cliffhouse sealrocks restaurant sanfranciscocalifornia" title="San Francisco, California, Cliff House, Seal Rocks, Restaurant" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/8150/7706489144_231cf9d956_b.jpg" username="photolibrarian" views="109" />
<photo  date_taken="2010-08-17 15:03:42" description="&lt;b&gt; THE LAMB BREAKS THE SEVEN SEALS&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;from Revelation (Apocalypse), Chapters 6-8&lt;/i&gt; Then I saw the Lamb break one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four animals shout in a voice like thunder, 'Come'. Immediately a white horse appeared, and the rider on it was holding a bow; he was given the victor's crown and he went away, to go from victory to victory. When he broke the second seal, I heard the second animal shout, 'Come'. And out came another horse, bright red, and its rider was given this duty: to take away peace from the earth and set people killing each other. He was given a huge sword. When he broke the third seal, I heard the third animal shout, 'Come'. Immediately a black horse appeared, and its rider was holding a pair of scales; and I seemed to hear a voice shout from among the four animals and say, 'A ration of corn for a day's wages, and three rations of barley for a day's wages, but do not tamper with the oil or the wine'. When he broke the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth animal shout, 'Come'. Immediately another horse appeared, deathly pale, and its rider was called Plague, and Hades followed at his heels. They were given authority over a quarter of the earth, to kill by the sword, by famine, by plague and wild beasts. When he broke the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of all the people who had been killed on account of the word of God, for witnessing to it. They shouted aloud, 'Holy, faithful Master, how much longer will you wait before you pass sentence and take vengeance for our death on the inhabitants of the earth?' Each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to be patient a little longer, until the roll was complete and their fellow servants and brothers had been killed just as they had been. In my vision, when he broke the sixth seal, there was a violent earthquake and the sun went as black as coarse sackcloth; the moon turned red as blood all over, and the stars of the sky fell on to the earth like figs dropping from a fig tree when a high wind shakes it; the sky disappeared like a scroll rolling up and all the mountains and islands were shaken from their places. Then all the earthly rulers, the governors and the commanders, the rich people and the men of influence, the whole population, slaves and citizens, took to the mountains to hide in caves and among the rocks. They said to the mountains and the rocks, 'Fall on us and hide us away from the One who sits on the throne and from the anger of the Lamb. For the Great Day of his anger has come, and who can survive it?' God's servants will be preserved Next I saw four angels, standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the world back to keep them from blowing over the land or the sea or in the trees. Then I saw another angel rising where the sun rises, carrying the seal of the living God; he called in a powerful voice to the four angels whose duty was to devastate land and sea, 'Wait before you do any damage on land or at sea or to the trees, until we have put the seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God'. Then I heard how many were sealed: a hundred and forty-four thousand, out of all the tribes of Israel. From the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand had been sealed; from the tribe of Reuben, twelve thousand; from the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand; from the tribe of Asher, twelve thousand; from the tribe of Naphtali, twelve thousand; from the tribe of Manasseh, twelve thousand; from the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand; from the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand; from the tribe of Issachar, twelve thousand; from the tribe of Zebulun, twelve thousand; from the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand; and from the tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand were sealed. After that I saw a huge number, impossible to count, of people from every nation, race, tribe and language; they were standing in front of the throne and in front of the Lamb, dressed in white robes and holding palms in their hands. They shouted aloud, 'Victory to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!' And all the angels who were standing in a circle round the throne, surrounding the elders and the four animals, prostrated themselves before the throne, and touched the ground with their foreheads, worshipping God with these words, 'Amen. Praise and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honour and power and strength to our God for ever and ever. Amen.' One of the elders then spoke, and asked me, 'Do you know who these people are, dressed in white robes, and where they have come from?' I answered him, 'You can tell me, my lord'. Then he said, 'These are the people who have been through the great persecution, and because they have washed their robes white again in the blood of the Lamb, they now stand in front of God's throne and serve him day and night in his sanctuary; and the One who sits on the throne will spread his tent over them. They will never hunger or thirst again; neither the sun nor scorching wind will ever plague them, because the Lamb who is at the throne will be their shepherd and will lead them to springs of living water; and God will wipe away all tears from their eyes. The Lamb then broke the seventh seal, and there was silence in heaven for about half an hour. Next I saw seven trumpets being given to the seven angels who stand in the presence of God. Another angel, who had a golden censer, came and stood at the altar. A large quantity of incense was given to him to offer with the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar that stood in front of the throne; and so from the angel's hand the smoke of the incense went up in the presence of God and with it the prayers of the saints. Then the angel took the censer and filled it with the fire from the altar, which he then threw down on to the earth; immediately there came peals of thunder and flashes of lightning, and the earth shook." id="5043333525" latitude="53.268331" license="1" longitude="-9.056596" nbComments="0" rank="23" tags="craig woodcut bible" title="(W.

Again I must write something about another friend of mine who has gone to rest, I knew him for thirty-four years. We were always cordial. There is a land where everlasting suns shed everlasting brightness, where the soul drinks from the living streams of love that roll by God's immortal throne, I believe he has gone there to inhale the breath of paradise divine. He was born at Greene, New York, November 14th, 1841. He left this earth January 7th, 1915. His heart ceased to beat at the age of seventy-four. Had he lived until February 13th, he could have celebrated his golden wedding. He was married February 13th, 1865, to Julia E. Ransford at Norwich in the old Empire State. He came to Chase county, Kansas, with his family in 1870, locating on Rock creek on a homestead, seven years later he moved to Cottonwood Falls, where he has since resided, except for a few years at the Soldiers Home. He served two terms as sheriff. He also served two terms as justice of the peace for Falls township. In 1906 the governor of Kansas offered him the position of adjutant of the Soldiers Home at Dodge City, a position that he held as long as his health would permit. As an official he was absolutely fearless in the discharge of his duty. I have often said that he was the best justice of the peace that I ever saw. He leaves a wife and two daughters, Mrs. Clyde Johnson of Lawrence, Kansas and Mrs. J. W. Holsinger of Cottonwood Falls. The widow who lived with him for almost fifty years resides in this city with her son-in-law, where Mr. Kinnie spent his last days. He was cared for by members of his family in the most tender way. The funeral was held at the residence of his son-in-law, J. W. Holsinger, January 9th, 1915. The funeral sermon by Rev. J. E. Bryan of the Methodist church was one of the best ever delivered in Cottonwood Falls. Many friends of Mr. Kinnie were present and those who could not get seats in the house stood around in the yard until the last word was spoken and then followed his remains to Prairie Grove cemetery and with deep regret saw his remains returned to earth. Mr. Kinnie was a philospher in many ways. He was not afraid to meet the pale-rider. He regarded the end of life as a radiant morning star indicating that the luminary of eternity is going to rise. A good man being asked during his last illness whether he thought himself dying said, &amp;quot;Really friend, I care not whether I am or not, for if I die I shall be with God; if I live God will be with me.&amp;quot; I am sure that Mr. Kinnie looked for happiness beyond this life. And I am sure that he thought that he carried the golden key that would open the palace of eternity. Edward A. Kinnie was an old soldier of the war of the rebellion. War is a mad game, at which the world seems to play, but Mr. Kinnie was not a man of blood. He became a soldier because he wanted to uphold the flickering torch of freedom, and he performed his part well. In 1861, when a very young man he enlisted in the 44th New York Infantry, and later he was promoted and made a lieutenant in the 99th New York Infantry. He served until the close of the war. In the army of the Potomac, he was one of two million men that marched to the music of the Union. He was a patriot and a good soldier. He has often told me about Seven Pines, Fairoaks, Savage Station, Chickahominey and the crowing glory of that army at Malvern Hill. He always had a warm place in his heart for a soldier who had stood in the storm and battled for home and human rights. He seemed to think that human liberty would never wither in the presence of such men, and the Almighty could intrust to them the destines of the globe. In the slaughter of thousands, Mr. Kinnie escaped unhurt, and yet the Deity had lent him no armour, like Achilles. This man deserves to be remembered and he will be. He saw the sun shrouded in the clouds of battle and saw him unveil the night with his fires. When the bloody drama of the Civil war was concluded Mr. Kinnie laid down his sword and resumed the avocation of peace. He was a frank positive out-spoken man. No deception in his make up. If there ever was an honest man in this world, that man was Edward A Kinnie. Full of charity for his fellow man, there is nothing to forget in the life of such a man, but there is much to be remembered. His deeds of benevolence will remain with us forever. It has been said that the first daughter to the love of God, is kindness to our fellow man. Gus Kinnie as he was called by his friends was kind to all. It was the breaking down of the forces of nature that lulled him to repose. He deserves to sleep well, and on decoration day his grave will be a shrine for his family and friends. Peace to his ashes.--Thos. H.

And what scenery it is -- island shorelines edged with sinewy, red madrona trees, golden bluffs, or rocky beaches. On clear days, snow capped Mt. Baker rises in awesome splendor in the east. Marine life, including seals, a variety of water birds, and of course, the ever present sea gulls can be spotted cavorting in the aquamarine glacial waters.

More information about this king &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus_II_the_Strong&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;on Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;- the story is tangled (what's a Polish king doing on a pedestal in Dresden, you might wonder) and full of silliness. For example, Augustus did not actually win the election (Poland had been electing its kings since a bout of interregnum in the late 16th century, with hilarious consequences...but that's another story) but he decided that he didn't care, and raced towards Cracow, where all Polish kings were crowned. He arrived there before the actual winner of the election, the French prince Conti, and bribed his supporters to grant him entry into the capital. But once inside, he discovered an insurmountable obstacle: the doors to the castle vault, where the royal insignia were kept, were shut, and six of the seven keys required to open them were in the hands of men who favoured Conti! What to do? To break down the doors would be a sacrilege. So, believe it or not, a hole was knocked in the vault wall. The sacred doors remained intact, the insignia were recovered, and in 1697, Augustus the Strong was crowned King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania (we were a Commonwealth back then). Seven years later, he was dethroned by the opposition...but refused to acknowledge the fact until 1706. And in 1709, he came back again! Backed by the Tsar Peter The Great, he climbed right back up on that throne. That's just a fraction of this guy's story. No wonder that his son decided his shamelessly perserverent parent deserved a golden statue in his honour." id="5465207148" latitude="51.058154" license="4" longitude="13.741214" nbComments="0" rank="30" tags="project3652011 project36612011" title="49/365: The Golden Rider" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/5139/5465207148_a9fbc5aa91_b.jpg" username="Magic Madzik" views="77" />

<photo  date_taken="2011-01-10 18:38:32" description="Here’s something you don’t see anymore, and for that matter didn’t see all that much when it was going on. During the Golden-Age from the forties to early 50’s it was pretty common to reuse art with just a few changes, such as art or color to changes to a Calvary uniform to turn it into a masked hero outfit, or new words over old art. It wasn’t the sort of thing the major players like DC, Fawcett, Dell or Quality did, nor the second tier player of the time such as Timely, or Archie. But among the third tier also-rans it was pretty common, not just buying the content that had been produced by another small company and using it all over again, but buying it and then blanking out the word balloons and turning it into a completely different story, after all while they didn‘t play the writers and artist a lot back then, 64 or 52 pages is a lot of fill every month. As an example a lot of what made up The Masked Rider, were old western stories from other companies with the words changed and a mask drawn over one of the characters to turn him into the title characters. Above is an example where Harry &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; Chesler Comics character The Master Key is turned a couple of years later into a crime comic detective, all they had to do was take out the eye beams and change the words. Or maybe it was the other way around and they turned a normal detective into a superhero. It could go either way. I mean it was not like anyone was paying any attention was it? Suppose they still did that sort of thing? Imagine you get a job at Johnny Comelately Comics, and NO they don’t want you’re innovations, you can keep Death Potato and his Vegetable Vigilantes to yourself thank you very much, they hand you a dozen comics from Marvel or DC that didn’t quite make it and they don’t care about anymore and J. C. C. Comics has bought the rights to the art, but not the names, characters or storyline and it’s your job to take Marvel’s Night Mask, or Rom the Space Knight, and change them into something completely different with only a few tweaks to the art work (hey we ain’t made of money and those guy charge a lot!) mostly to make sure characters that Marvel is still using are taken out, and all new words, or a collection of random House of Mystery’s from DC from the 80’s that don’t have a continuing character and you have to turn it into one with the same restrictions as above, perhaps you can have a costume put over one character in each story to tie them together. You know, on second thought that might be kind of fun. Anyway… they don’t do that anymore." id="5344147907" latitude="0" license="2" longitude="0" nbComments="0" rank="97" tags="goldenage comics comicbook superhero" title="We Paid For the Art and by Gum We're USING it!" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/5087/5344147907_6c53fbea1c_b.jpg" username="Felix_Nine" views="90" />
