<photo  date_taken="2007-06-18 10:37:23" description="For those of us that have a greater love of photography than a fear of heights, there is a popular observation deck in downtown Cincinnati. Carew Tower is a 49 story, 574-foot skyscraper that was the tallest in town until 2010. For a couple of dollars, visitors can take an elevator up to about the 47th floor, then walk to anotehr elevator which goes the last part of the way where you can walk around the roof. From here, on a clear day you can see for miles. This series of 20 photos was taken in 2007 back when my camera had a 10X optical zoom. The historic Cincinnati and Covington Suspension Bridge opened in 1866 to cross the Ohio River. Since then, it's been renamed after its designer John A. Roebling who went on to design the Brooklyn Bridge. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 and designated a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1983. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cincinnati-transit.net/suspension.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.cincinnati-transit.net/suspension.html&lt;/a&gt;" id="8458438462" latitude="0" license="2" longitude="0" nbComments="0" rank="9" tags="cincinnati cincy cinti oh ohio carewtowerobservationdeck carewtowerobservatory bmok bmok2 bridge suspensionbridge ohioriver covington ky kentucky nrhp nationalhistoriccivilengineeringlandmark cincinnaticovingtonbridge cincinnatifromabove" title="Cincinnati From Above #2: Roebling Bridge" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/8519/8458438462_7f78613538_b.jpg" username="SeeMidTN.com (aka Brent)" views="26" />

In 1847, Amos Shinkle relocated to Covington. Shinkle established a coal business in Northern Kentucky. His business was a coal reloading dock for steamships plying the Ohio River. The endeavor proved very successful. Shinkle also constructed and sold a number of steamboats during this era.

<photo  date_taken="2006-07-03 17:08:55" description="The Brooklyn Bridge (originally the New York and Brooklyn Bridge) stretches 5,989 feet (1825 m) over the East River (main span of 1,595 feet 6 inches) connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn. On completion, it was the largest suspension bridge in the world--fifty percent longer than any previously built, and the first steel-wire suspension bridge. For several years, the towers were also the tallest structures in the Western Hemipshere. Designed by an engineering firm owned by John Augustus Roebling, the bridge is built from limestone, granite, and Rosendale natural cement in Gothic style, with characteristic pointed arches above the passageways through the stone towers. Roebling and his firm had built smaller suspension bridges, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/tags/johnaroeblingsuspensionbridge/&quot;&gt;John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge in Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt;, and the Waco Suspension Bridge in Waco, Texas, that served as prototypes for the final design. Construction began on January 3, 1870 and the bridge was opened on May 24, 1883. On that first day, a total of 1,800 vehicles and 150,300 people crossed. The bridge cost $15.1 million to build and approximately 27 people died during its construction, including Roebling. As construction was beginning, Roebling's foot was injured by a ferry when it crashed into a wharf; within a few weeks, he died of tetanus caused by the amputation of his toes. His son, Washington, succeeded him, but was stricken with caisson disease (decompression sickness, commonly known as 'the bends'), from working in compressed air in caissons, in 1872. His wife, Emily Warren Roebling, became his aide, learning engineering and communicating his wishes to the on-site assistants. A week after the opening, on May 30, a rumor that the Bridge was going to collapse caused a stampede which crushed 12 people. Bridges were not tested in wind tunnels until the 1950s. Roebling therefore designed the open truss structure supporting the deck to be six times as strong as he guessed it needed to be. A substitution of inferior qualify wire in the cabling, though, left the bridge just four times stronger, though. Either way, Roebling's design has held up in all conditions over the years. At various times, the bridge has carried horses, subways (until 1944) and trolley streetcars (until 1950), it currently has 6 lanes for motor vehicles, with a separate walkway along the centerline for pedestrians.

On completion, it was the largest suspension bridge in the world--fifty percent longer than any previously built, and the first steel-wire suspension bridge. For several years, the towers were also the tallest structures in the Western Hemipshere. Designed by an engineering firm owned by John Augustus Roebling, the bridge is built from limestone, granite, and Rosendale natural cement in Gothic style, with characteristic pointed arches above the passageways through the stone towers. Roebling and his firm had built smaller suspension bridges, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/tags/johnaroeblingsuspensionbridge/&quot;&gt;John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge in Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt;, and the Waco Suspension Bridge in Waco, Texas, that served as prototypes for the final design. Construction began on January 3, 1870 and the bridge was opened on May 24, 1883. On that first day, a total of 1,800 vehicles and 150,300 people crossed. The bridge cost $15.1 million to build and approximately 27 people died during its construction, including Roebling. As construction was beginning, Roebling's foot was injured by a ferry when it crashed into a wharf; within a few weeks, he died of tetanus caused by the amputation of his toes. His son, Washington, succeeded him, but was stricken with caisson disease (decompression sickness, commonly known as 'the bends'), from working in compressed air in caissons, in 1872. His wife, Emily Warren Roebling, became his aide, learning engineering and communicating his wishes to the on-site assistants. A week after the opening, on May 30, a rumor that the Bridge was going to collapse caused a stampede which crushed 12 people. Bridges were not tested in wind tunnels until the 1950s. Roebling therefore designed the open truss structure supporting the deck to be six times as strong as he guessed it needed to be. A substitution of inferior qualify wire in the cabling, though, left the bridge just four times stronger, though. Either way, Roebling's design has held up in all conditions over the years. At various times, the bridge has carried horses, subways (until 1944) and trolley streetcars (until 1950), it currently has 6 lanes for motor vehicles, with a separate walkway along the centerline for pedestrians.

Roebling and his firm had built smaller suspension bridges, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/tags/johnaroeblingsuspensionbridge/&quot;&gt;John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge in Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt;, and the Waco Suspension Bridge in Waco, Texas, that served as prototypes for the final design. Construction began on January 3, 1870 and the bridge was opened on May 24, 1883. On that first day, a total of 1,800 vehicles and 150,300 people crossed. The bridge cost $15.1 million to build and approximately 27 people died during its construction, including Roebling. As construction was beginning, Roebling's foot was injured by a ferry when it crashed into a wharf; within a few weeks, he died of tetanus caused by the amputation of his toes. His son, Washington, succeeded him, but was stricken with caisson disease (decompression sickness, commonly known as 'the bends'), from working in compressed air in caissons, in 1872. His wife, Emily Warren Roebling, became his aide, learning engineering and communicating his wishes to the on-site assistants. A week after the opening, on May 30, a rumor that the Bridge was going to collapse caused a stampede which crushed 12 people. Bridges were not tested in wind tunnels until the 1950s. Roebling therefore designed the open truss structure supporting the deck to be six times as strong as he guessed it needed to be. A substitution of inferior qualify wire in the cabling, though, left the bridge just four times stronger, though. Either way, Roebling's design has held up in all conditions over the years. At various times, the bridge has carried horses, subways (until 1944) and trolley streetcars (until 1950), it currently has 6 lanes for motor vehicles, with a separate walkway along the centerline for pedestrians.

<photo  date_taken="2004-06-01 00:00:00" description="When the 1,057-foot-long Cincinnati and Covington Suspension Bridge opened to traffic on December 1, 1866, it was the longest suspension bridge in the world. It was completed not long after the close of the Civil War, connecting Cincinnati with Covington, Ohio with Kentucky, and the North with the South. The designer and builder of the bridge, John A. Roebling, used the Cincinnati bridge as his prototype when he later built the longer and more famous Brooklyn Bridge, which opened in 1883 in New York City. The Cincinnati and Covington Bridge was renamed for its designer in 1984. Several newer and more modern bridges now span the Ohio River in and around Cincinnati, and the Roebling Bridge carries much less traffic than the others. That's good, because I consider a walk across the old Suspension Bridge a must to fully experience Cincinnati. A wide walkway goes along either side of the bridge and on a recent Saturday I walked across on one side and back on the other. There were a few folk who had put their lawn chairs up near the center of the walkway and were enjoying an afternoon in the sun while they watched the river traffic below." id="2840100926" latitude="39.106468" license="2" longitude="-84.504768" nbComments="0" rank="51" tags="cincinnati hamiltoncounty ohio johnaroebling roebling bridge ohioriver kentucky covington oh kentoncounty ky" title="John A.

<photo  date_taken="2011-03-25 15:39:32" description="The bridge opened to pedestrians in December 1866, and the 1,057ft. main span was at that time the longest in the world, surpassing the Wheeling, WV suspension bridge (1849). Not only was the Cincinnati Suspension Bridge the world's longest, but it was also the first to utilize both vertical suspenders and diagonal stays fanning from either tower. This advance was next seen on the Brooklyn Bridge (also designed by John Roebling), which surpassed the Cincinnati bridge in length and almost every other statistical category in 1883. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cincinnati-transit.net/suspension.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.cincinnati-transit.net/suspension.html&lt;/a&gt;" id="5562590181" latitude="39.093015" license="3" longitude="-84.509947" nbComments="1" rank="52" tags="vintage ohio panasonic bridge lumix fz100 dmcfz100 cincinnati old america john a roebling suspension ohioriver river covington midwest northamerica portrait antique" title="The John A.

<photo  date_taken="2011-03-25 15:41:28" description="Few American cities can claim a landmark as distinctive as Cincinnati's Suspension Bridge. The Covington and Cincinnati Bridge, in 1984 renamed after designer John A. Roebling, and all the while called by locals simply &amp;quot;The Suspension Bridge&amp;quot;, has been a symbol of the city since its completion in December of 1866. Images of the bridge can be seen today in all parts of the city hanging in homes, offices, restaurants, bars, waiting rooms, and as backdrops for the local television news. More than just a nostalgic decoration, the old bridge remains an important river crossing for thousands of cars and buses each day. The bridge will close in October of 2006 for a year of repairs and repainting, however the bridge is expected to carry vehicular traffic for several more decades. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cincinnati-transit.net/suspension.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.cincinnati-transit.net/suspension.html&lt;/a&gt;" id="5563166460" latitude="39.093015" license="3" longitude="-84.509947" nbComments="1" rank="53" tags="vintage ohio panasonic bridge lumix fz100 dmcfz100 cincinnati old america john a roebling suspension ohioriver river covington midwest northamerica portrait antique" title="The John A.

I think of the two I like this the most, but less because of the difference in exposure but more from the slight difference in composition, I was closer to the bridge with this shot and feel that the cables to the top left of the image produce a more solid leading light that gives a better sense of depth into the image.

Roebling Suspension Bridge spans the Ohio River between Cincinnati, Ohio and Covington, Kentucky. When the first pedestrians crossed on December 1, 1866, it was the longest suspension bridge in the world at 1,057 feet (322 m), a status it maintained until 1883. Construction continued for over ten years, interrupted by financial shortages and the Civil War, during which the city and the unfinished bridge were under threat of attack. The bridge was completed in December 1866. As the first bridge to use both vertical suspenders and diagonal stays fanning from each of its 230-foot (70 m) stone towers, it served as the prototype for Roebling's design of the Brooklyn Bridge, which exceeded the Cincinnati bridge in length when it opened in New York in 1883. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.roeblingbridge.com/&quot;&gt;www.roeblingbridge.com/&lt;/a&gt;" id="2357284135" latitude="0" license="3" longitude="0" nbComments="2" rank="91" tags="acqua agua dwr eau het vand vanduo vatten voda wasser water woda νερό нещоmarch2008 cincinnati ohio ohioriver covington kentucky" title="View of Roebling Suspension Bridge from Kentucky, Ohio River nearing flood stage" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/2040/2357284135_94fea3b17f_b.jpg" username="elycefeliz" views="229" />

Roebling Suspension Bridge spans the Ohio River between Cincinnati, Ohio and Covington, Kentucky. When the first pedestrians crossed on December 1, 1866, it was the longest suspension bridge in the world at 1,057 feet (322 m), a status it maintained until 1883. Construction continued for over ten years, interrupted by financial shortages and the Civil War, during which the city and the unfinished bridge were under threat of attack. The bridge was completed in December 1866. As the first bridge to use both vertical suspenders and diagonal stays fanning from each of its 230-foot (70 m) stone towers, it served as the prototype for Roebling's design of the Brooklyn Bridge, which exceeded the Cincinnati bridge in length when it opened in New York in 1883. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.roeblingbridge.com/&quot;&gt;www.roeblingbridge.com/&lt;/a&gt;" id="2354695678" latitude="39.089567" license="3" longitude="-84.51044" nbComments="0" rank="127" tags="march2008 covington kentucky geotaggedohio acqua agua dwr eau het vand vanduo vatten voda wasser water woda νερό нещо" title="View of Cincinnati from Kentucky, Ohio River nearing flood stage" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/2100/2354695678_aa72139908_b.jpg" username="elycefeliz" views="1119" />

On completion, it was the largest suspension bridge in the world--fifty percent longer than any previously built, and the first steel-wire suspension bridge. For several years, the towers were also the tallest structures in the Western Hemisphere. Designed by an engineering firm owned by John Augustus Roebling, the bridge is built from limestone, granite, and Rosendale natural cement in Gothic style, with characteristic pointed arches above the passageways through the stone towers. Roebling and his firm had built smaller suspension bridges, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/tags/johnaroeblingsuspensionbridge/&quot;&gt;John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge in Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt;, and the Waco Suspension Bridge in Waco, Texas, that served as prototypes for the final design. Construction began on January 3, 1870 and the bridge was opened on May 24, 1883. On that first day, a total of 1,800 vehicles and 150,300 people crossed. The bridge cost $15.1 million to build and approximately 27 people died during its construction, including Roebling. As construction was beginning, Roebling's foot was injured by a ferry when it crashed into a wharf; within a few weeks, he died of tetanus caused by the amputation of his toes. His son, Washington, succeeded him, but was stricken with caisson disease (decompression sickness, commonly known as 'the bends'), from working in compressed air in caissons, in 1872. His wife, Emily Warren Roebling, became his aide, learning engineering and communicating his wishes to the on-site assistants. A week after the opening, on May 30, a rumor that the Bridge was going to collapse caused a stampede which crushed 12 people. Bridges were not tested in wind tunnels until the 1950s. Roebling therefore designed the open truss structure supporting the deck to be six times as strong as he guessed it needed to be. A substitution of inferior qualify wire in the cabling, though, left the bridge just four times stronger, though. Either way, Roebling's design has held up in all conditions over the years. At various times, the bridge has carried horses, subways (until 1944) and trolley streetcars (until 1950), it currently has 6 lanes for motor vehicles, with a separate walkway along the centerline for pedestrians.

Construction began on January 3, 1870 and the bridge was opened on May 24, 1883. On that first day, a total of 1,800 vehicles and 150,300 people crossed. The bridge cost $15.1 million to build and approximately 27 people died during its construction, including Roebling. As construction was beginning, Roebling's foot was injured by a ferry when it crashed into a wharf; within a few weeks, he died of tetanus caused by the amputation of his toes. His son, Washington, succeeded him, but was stricken with caisson disease (decompression sickness, commonly known as 'the bends'), from working in compressed air in caissons, in 1872. His wife, Emily Warren Roebling, became his aide, learning engineering and communicating his wishes to the on-site assistants. A week after the opening, on May 30, a rumor that the Bridge was going to collapse caused a stampede which crushed 12 people. Bridges were not tested in wind tunnels until the 1950s. Roebling therefore designed the open truss structure supporting the deck to be six times as strong as he guessed it needed to be. A substitution of inferior qualify wire in the cabling, though, left the bridge just four times stronger, though. Either way, Roebling's design has held up in all conditions over the years. At various times, the bridge has carried horses, subways (until 1944) and trolley streetcars (until 1950), it currently has 6 lanes for motor vehicles, with a separate walkway along the centerline for pedestrians.
