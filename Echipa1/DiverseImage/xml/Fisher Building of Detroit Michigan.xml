<photo  date_taken="2010-05-10 10:15:13" description="Michigan Central Station When the old Michigan Central Depot burned on December 26, 1913 the still unfinished structure off of Michigan Ave. was called into service. Designed by noted hotel architects Warren &amp;amp; Wetmore and engineers Reed and Stem, the MCS was an exceptionally beautiful building. The style of choice was beaux-arts neoclassical. Flanking massive arched windows were pairs of Corinthian columns, a hallmark of the style. Inside the rooms were modeled after an ancient Roman bathhouse, particularly the massive main waiting room. With an impressive vaulted ceiling this room was the most imposing in the building. Smaller rooms for women and men were placed at either end of the waiting room as were a cafe and restaurant. Deeper into the station was a hall of massive paired Doric columns. This area housed the ticket office and a long shopping arcade. Beyond them one entered another large space, the concourse. It was at the concourse that one departed for their trains. The room was far simpler then the waiting room, with walls of brick rather then marble. But it featured a massive copper skylight. From the concourse one passed through a similarly styled ramp down into a long tunnel to the train platforms. 1913 shot The MCS prior to opening. The station's most distinctive architectural feature lay not inside but was the office tower rising above the station proper. Rumored as a possible hotel, it actually housed offices. The lower floors had marble lined corridors while the upper floors were bare. The top floor was never finished, its walls never being plastered over. Architecturally this mass was joined to the station with a band or pilasters running around the upper floors. The total composition included 18 levels above ground. A massive basement level provided facilities for baggage and mail. When the station first opened automobiles were still not common. Therefore the station was not, nor would ever be, given decent parking facilities. The intended main entrance was not the grand northern entrance dominated with the three huge arches. Rather, the most used entrance was intended to be the east entrance. This was made so by the presence of a streetcar terminal there. Because of the station's distance from downtown it was thought that most passengers would arrive via streetcar or interurban. They would exit the streetcar at the terminal and then enter the station through the east entrance. With the Depression came the end of the interurban service and by 1938 the street cars were gone. The station was suddenly isolated. waiting room The Waiting Room. The station's isolation had not been a great concern in 1913. It was believed that the presence of a large station would cause the business district to spread towards the area. This had been the case with the Pennsylvania Station in New York. The slum in which it had been built quickly transformed into one of the city's finest retail addresses. Unfortunately, such developments never took place for the MCS. During the mid twenties, Henry Ford purchased land and planned to build a large business center. However land values, the General Moters-Fisher Building complex, and the Great Depression put an end to these plans. tunnel The passenger tunnel. The station thrived prior to the Second World War. During the Second World War the rails were crowded with military traffic and the MCS saw many tearful good-byes as soldiers departed for the front. After the Second World War, however, the slow decline began. Automobiles gradually took over the Detroit-Chicago route. The loss of passenger traffic become so bad that by 1956 an attempt is made to sell the station for $5,000,000. There were no buyers. Profits continued to decline and by 1963 another attempt was made to sell the station, once again there were no buyers. The station's decline is made painfully obvious in 1967 when the main waiting room and park entrance are closed due to declining passenger traffic. Also facilities such as the arcade shops and restaurant closed. Gradually the building deteriorated. 1980s The station towards the end. In 1971 Amtrak took over the nations passenger service. Once again things started to look bright for the station. In 1975 the main entrance and waiting room were reopened. Better yet, in 1978 $1,250,000 worth of renovations begin. These include new track, bus facilities, and cleaning. The offices were used by Conrail. These bright days did not last. In 1984 the station was sold for a transportation center that never materialized. And then the unthinkable. Passenger traffic declined so severely that the decision was made to close the facility. On January 5, 1988 the last train departed. The building was permanently closed later that day. The building then started its quiet decay. Open throughout much of the 90's, the station has been vandalized. Its plaster and brass details were gutted out by scavengers. Currently there has been discussion of its renovation as the new Detroit Police headquarters." id="4598194341" latitude="42.329124" license="4" longitude="-83.077583" nbComments="1" rank="8" tags="detroit michigan mcs michigancentralstation photoshoot architecture fun day monday may city walk play cimalacustomphotography 2011" title="Depot Decrepidation - MCS" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/4001/4598194341_6852bb687e_b.jpg" username="LadyDragonflyCC - Winter/Spring in Michigan?" views="123" />

<photo  date_taken="2011-06-17 14:47:46" description="Robert Coleman stopped me while I was taking photographs of the old Fisher plant. He is a veteran and a writer living in the area. We talked about the condition of the city and the ebb and flow of hope and despair all of us who truly love this town feel on a daily basis. He told me the real tragedy is when you consider the children in the area. A 10 year old walks past this scene of abandonment and decay every day and probably doesn’t think much of it. This is, after all, all he knows. As time moves along, the scene changes very little and as a 20 year old his visual cues are almost static - more broken glass, a few more loose bricks and new graffiti. As a young adult, his vision of what could be, or should be, for the city and his own life have been weighed down by all of this institutional neglect. His faith is challenged, if not lost, by the time he is ready to start a family. So he leaves. And the cycle continues. This is all part of the economic Rapture taking place in the industrial heartland. The middle class have been called to their economic heaven in the suburbs or the Sunbelt. All that is left behind are folks with little means living in some Cormac McCarthy nightmare landscape. A few hipsters moving in to scoop up cheap studio space is a good thing, but it is not enough. The city’s rebirth will be marked by the influx of families looking to build a better life.

The inspectors, usually called &amp;quot;mounted guards&amp;quot;, operated out of El Paso, Texas. Though they never totaled more than 75, they patrolled as far west as California trying to restrict the flow of illegal Chinese immigration. In March 1915, Congress authorized a separate group of mounted guards, often referred to as &amp;quot;mounted inspectors&amp;quot;. Most rode on horseback, but a few operated automobiles, motorcycles and boats. Although these inspectors had broader arrest authority, they still largely pursued Chinese immigrants trying to avoid the National Origins Act and Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. These patrolmen were Immigrant Inspectors, assigned to inspection stations, and could not watch the border at all times. U.S. Army troops along the southwest border performed intermittent border patrolling, but this was secondary to &amp;quot;the more serious work of military training.&amp;quot; Non-nationals encountered illegally in the U.S. by the army were directed to the immigration inspection stations. Texas Rangers were also sporadically assigned to patrol duties by the state, and their efforts were noted as &amp;quot;singularly effective&amp;quot;. The Border Patrol was founded on May 28, 1924 as an agency of the United States Department of Labor to prevent illegal entries along the Mexico–United States border and the United States-Canada border. The first two border patrol stations were in El Paso, Texas and Detroit, Michigan.[2] Additional operations were established along the Gulf Coast in 1927 to perform crewman control to insure that non-American crewmen departed on the same ship on which they arrived. Additional stations were temporarily added along the Gulf Coast, Florida and the Eastern Seaboard during the sixties when in Cuba triumphed the Cuban Revolution and emerged the Cuban Missile Crisis. Prior to 2003, the Border Patrol was part of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), an agency that was within the U.S. Department of Justice. INS was disbanded in March 2003 when its operations were divided between CBP, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The priority mission of the Border Patrol, as a result of the 9/11 attacks and its merging into the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is to prevent terrorists and terrorist weapons from entering the United States of America. However, the Border Patrol's traditional mission remains as the deterrence, detection and apprehension of illegal immigrants and individuals involved in the illegal drug trade who generally enter the United States other than through designated ports of entry. The Border Patrol also operates 33 permanent interior checkpoints along the southern border of the United States. Currently, the U.S. Border Patrol employs over 20,200 agents (as of the end of fiscal year 2009),[3] who are specifically responsible for patrolling the 6,000 miles of Mexican and Canadian international land borders and 2,000 miles of coastal waters surrounding the Florida Peninsula and the island of Puerto Rico. Agents are assigned primarily to the Mexico–United States border, where they are assigned to control drug trafficking and illegal immigration.[4] Patrols on horseback have made a comeback since smugglers have been pushed into the more remote mountainous regions, which are hard to cover with modern tracking strategies.[5] [edit] Strategy [edit] 1986: Employer sanctions and interior enforcement Border Patrol Agents with a Hummer and Astar patrol for illegal entry into U.S.The Border Patrol's priorities have changed over the years. In 1986, the Immigration Reform and Control Act placed renewed emphasis on controlling illegal immigration by going after the employers that hire illegal immigrants. The belief was that jobs were the magnet that attracted most illegal immigrants to come to the United States. The Border Patrol increased interior enforcement and Form I-9 audits of businesses through an inspection program known as &amp;quot;employer sanctions&amp;quot;. Several agents were assigned to interior stations, such as within the Livermore Sector in Northern California. Employer sanctions never became the effective tool it was expected to be by Congress. Illegal immigration continued to swell after the 1986 amnesty despite employer sanctions. By 1993, Californians passed Proposition 187, denying benefits to illegal immigrants and criminalizing illegal immigrants in possession of forged green cards, I.D. cards and Social Security Numbers. It also authorized police officers to question non-nationals as to their immigration status and required police and sheriff departments to cooperate and report illegal immigrants to the INS. Proposition 187 drew nationwide attention to illegal immigration. [edit] Inspection stations United States Border Patrol Interior Checkpoints are inspection stations operated by the USBP within 100 miles of a national border (with Mexico or Canada) or in the Florida Keys. As federal inspection stations are also operated by the Mexican government within 50 km of its borders where they are officially known as a &amp;quot;Garita de Revisión.&amp;quot; or Garitas, they are known also by that name to Latinos. [edit] El Paso Sector's Operation Hold the Line El Paso Sector Chief Patrol Agent (and future U.S. congressman) Silvestre Reyes started a program called &amp;quot;Operation Hold the Line&amp;quot;. In this program, Border Patrol agents would no longer react to illegal entries resulting in apprehensions, but would instead be forward deployed to the border, immediately detecting any attempted entries or deterring crossing at a more remote location. The idea was that it would be easier to capture illegal entrants in the wide open deserts than through the urban alleyways. Chief Reyes deployed his agents along the Rio Grande River, within eyesight of other agents. The program significantly reduced illegal entries in the urban part of El Paso, however, the operation merely shifted the illegal entries to other areas. [edit] San Diego Sector's Operation Gatekeeper A Border Patrol Jeep stands watch over the U.S.-Mexico border at San Ysidro, California.San Diego Sector tried Silvestre Reyes' approach of forward deploying agents to deter illegal entries into the country. Congress authorized the hiring of thousands of new agents, and many were sent to San Diego Sector.[citation needed] In addition, Congressman Duncan Hunter obtained surplus military landing mats to use as a border fence.[citation needed] Stadium lighting, ground sensors and infra-red cameras were also placed in the area.[citation needed] Apprehensions decreased dramatically in that area as people crossed in different regions. [edit] Tucson Sector's Operation Safeguard California was no longer the hotbed of illegal entry and the traffic shifted to Arizona, primarily in Nogales and Douglas.[citation needed] The Border Patrol instituted the same deterrent strategy it used in San Diego to Arizona. [edit] Northern border In 2001, the Border Patrol had approximately 340 agents assigned along the Canada – United States border border. Northern border staffing had been increased to 1,128 agents to 1,470 agents by the end of fiscal year 2008, and is projected to expand to 1,845 by the end of fiscal year 2009, a sixfold increase. Resources that support Border Patrol agents include the use of new technology and a more focused application of air and marine assets. The northern border sectors are Blaine (Washington), Buffalo (New York), Detroit (Selfridge ANGB, Michigan), Grand Forks (North Dakota), Havre (Montana), Houlton (Maine), Spokane (Washington), and Swanton (Vermont). [edit] Border Patrol moves away from interior enforcement In the 1990s, Congress mandated that the Border Patrol shift agents away from the interior and focus them on the borders. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Department of Homeland Security created two immigration enforcement agencies out of the defunct Immigration and Naturalization Service: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). ICE was tasked with investigations, detention and removal of illegal immigrants, and interior enforcement. CBP was tasked with inspections at U.S. ports of entry and with preventing illegal entries between the port of entry, transportation check, and entries on U.S. coastal borders. DHS management decided to align the Border Patrol with CBP. CBP itself is solely responsible for the nation's ports of entry, while Border Patrol maintains jurisdiction over all locations between ports of entry, giving Border Patrol agents federal authority absolutely[dubious – discuss] nationwide[dubious – discuss]. In July 2004, the Livermore Sector of the United States Border Patrol was closed. Livermore Sector served Northern California and included stations at Dublin (Parks Reserve Forces Training Area), Sacramento, Stockton, Fresno and Bakersfield. The Border Patrol also closed other stations in the interior of the United States including Roseburg, Oregon and Little Rock, Arkansas. The Border Patrol functions in these areas consisted largely of local jail and transportation terminal checks for illegal immigrants. These functions were turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. [edit] The new strategy Cameras add &amp;quot;Smart Border&amp;quot; surveillance.In November 2005, the U.S. Border Patrol published an updated national strategy.[6] The goal of this updated strategy is operational control of the United States border. The strategy has five main objectives: Apprehend terrorists and terrorist weapons illegally entering the United States; Deter illegal entries through improved enforcement; Detect, apprehend, and deter smugglers of humans, drugs, and other contraband; Use &amp;quot;smart border&amp;quot; technology; and Reduce crime in border communities, improving quality of life. [edit] Capabilities The border is a barely discernible line in uninhabited deserts, canyons, or mountains. The Border Patrol utilizes a variety of equipment and methods, such as electronic sensors placed at strategic locations along the border, to detect people or vehicles entering the country illegally. Video monitors and night vision scopes are also used to detect illegal entries. Agents patrol the border in vehicles, boats, aircraft, and afoot. In some areas, the Border Patrol employs horses, all-terrain motorcycles, bicycles, and snowmobiles. Air surveillance capabilities are provided by unmanned aerial vehicles.[3] The primary activity of a Border Patrol Agent is &amp;quot;Line Watch&amp;quot;. Line Watch involves the detection, prevention, and apprehension of terrorists, undocumented aliens and smugglers of aliens at or near the land border by maintaining surveillance from a covert position; following up on leads; responding to electronic sensor television systems and aircraft sightings; and interpreting and following tracks, marks, and other physical evidence. Major activities include traffic check, traffic observation, city patrol, transportation check, administrative, intelligence, and anti-smuggling activities.[4] Traffic checks are conducted on major highways leading away from the border to detect and apprehend illegal aliens attempting to travel further into the interior of the United States after evading detection at the border, and to detect illegal narcotics.[3] Transportation checks are inspections of interior-bound conveyances, which include buses, commercial aircraft, passenger and freight trains, and marine craft.[3] Marine Patrols are conducted along the coastal waterways of the United States, primarily along the Pacific coast, the Caribbean, the tip of Florida, and Puerto Rico and interior waterways common to the United States and Canada. Border Patrol conducts border control activities from 130 marine craft of various sizes. The Border Patrol maintains watercraft ranging from blue-water craft to inflatable-hull craft, in 16 sectors, in addition to headquarters special operations components.[3] Horse and bike patrols are used to augment regular vehicle and foot patrols. Horse units patrol remote areas along the international boundary that are inaccessible to standard all-terrain vehicles. Bike patrol aids city patrol and is used over rough terrain to support linewatch.[3] Snowmobiles are used to patrol remote areas along the northern border in the winter. [edit] Expansion Attrition in the Border Patrol was normally at 5%. From 1995-2001 attrition spiked to above 10%, which was a period when the Border Patrol was undergoing massive hiring. In 2002 the attrition rate climbed to 18%. The 18% attrition was largely attributed to agents transferring to the Federal Air Marshals after 9/11. Since that time the attrition problem has decreased significantly and Congress has increased journeyman Border Patrol Agent pay from GS-9 to GS-11 in 2002. The Border Patrol Marine Position was created in 2009 (BPA-M). This position will be updated to a GS-12 position sometime in 2010 or 2011. Border Patrol Field Training Officers may possibly be updated in 2010 to a temporary GS-12 pay rate. In 2005, Border Patrol attrition dropped to 4% and remains in the area of 4% to 6% as of 2009.[7] The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (signed by President Bush on December 17, 2004) authorized hiring an additional 10,000 agents, &amp;quot;subject to appropriation&amp;quot;. This authorization, if fully implemented, would nearly double the Border Patrol manpower from 11,000 to 21,000 agents by 2010. In July 2005, Congress signed the Emergency Supplemental Spending Act for military operations in Iraq/Afghanistan and other operations. The act also appropriated funding to increase Border Patrol manpower by 500 Agents. In October 2005, President Bush also signed the DHS FY06 Appropriation bill, funding an additional 1,000 Agents. In November 2005, President George W. Bush made a trip to southern Arizona to discuss more options that would decrease illegal crossings at the U.S. and Mexican border. In his proposed fiscal year 2007 budget he has requested an additional 1,500 Border Patrol agents. The Secure Fence Act, signed by President George W. Bush on October 26, 2006, has met with much opposition. In October 2007, environmental groups and concerned citizens filed a restraining order hoping to halt the construction of the fence, set to be built between the United States and Mexico. The act mandates that the fence be built by December 2008. Ultimately, the United States seeks to put fencing around the 1,945-mile (3,130 km) border, but the act requires only 700 miles (1,100 km) of fencing. DHS secretary Michael Chertoff has bypassed environmental and other oppositions with a waiver that was granted to him by Congress in Section 102 of the act, which allows DHS to avoid any conflicts that would prevent a speedy assembly of the fence.[8][9] This action has led many environment groups and landowners to speak out against the impending construction of the fence.[10] Environment and wildlife groups fear that the plans to clear brush, construct fences, install bright lights, motion sensors, and cameras will scare wildlife and endanger the indigenous species of the area.[11] Environmentalists claim that the ecosystem could be affected due to the fact that a border fence would restrict movement of all animal species, which in turn would keep them from water and food sources on one side or another. Desert plants would also feel the impact, as they would be uprooted in many areas where the fence is set to occupy.[12] Property owners in these areas fear a loss of land. Landowners would have to give some of their land over to the government for the fence. Citizens also fear that communities will be split. Many students travel over the border every day to attend classes at the University of Texas at Brownsville. Brownsville mayor Pat Ahumada favors alternative options to a border fence. He suggests that the Rio Grande River be widened and deepened to provide for a natural barrier to hinder illegal immigrants and drug smugglers.[13] The United States Border Patrol Academy is located in Artesia, New Mexico.

Recruits are instructed in Border Patrol and federal law enforcement subjects. Border Patrol courses include: Immigration and Nationality Law, Criminal Law and Statutory Authority, Spanish, Border Patrol Operations, Care and Use of Firearms, Physical Training, Driver Training, and Anti-Terrorism. FLETC courses include: Communications, Ethics and Conduct, Report Writing, Introduction to Computers, Fingerprinting, and Constitutional Law.[15] The physical aspects of the Border Patrol Training Program are extremely demanding. At the end of 55 days, trainees must be able to complete a one and a half mile run in 13 minutes or less, a confidence course in two and a half minutes or less, and a 220 yard dash in 46 seconds or less. This final test is much easier than the day to day physical training during the program.[15] [edit] Uniforms The Border Patrol currently wears the following types of uniforms: CBP officers at a ceremony in 2007Dress uniform – The dress uniform consists of olive-green trousers with a blue stripe, and an olive-green shirt, which may or may not have blue shoulder straps. The campaign hat is worn with uniform. Ceremonial uniform – When required, the following items are added to the dress uniform to complete the ceremonial uniform: olive-green Ike jacket or tunic with blue accents (shoulder straps and cuffs, blue tie, brass tie tack, white gloves, and olive-green felt campaign hat with leather hat band. The campaign hat is worn with uniform. Rough duty uniform – The rough duty uniform consists of green cargo trousers and work shirt (in short or long sleeves). Usually worn with green baseball cap or tan stetson. Accessories, footwear, and outerwear – Additional items are worn in matching blue or black colors as appropriate. Organization patches – The Border Patrol wears two: The CBP patch is worn on the right sleeves of the uniform. It contains the DHS seal against a black background with a &amp;quot;keystone&amp;quot; shape. A &amp;quot;keystone&amp;quot; is the central, wedge-shaped stone in an arch, which holds all the other stones in place. Border Patrol agents retain the circular legacy Border Patrol patch, which is worn on the left sleeve. The Border Patrol uniform is getting its first makeover since the 1950s to appear more like military fatigues and less like a police officer's duty garb.[16] Leather belts with brass buckles are being replaced by nylon belts with quick-release plastic buckles, slacks are being replaced by lightweight cargo pants, and shiny badges and nameplates are being replaced by cloth patches.

It can contain as many as 13 rounds of ammunition (12 in the magazine and one in the chamber). Like other law enforcement agencies, the Remington 870 is the standard shotgun. Border Patrol Agents also commonly carry the M4 Carbine and the H&amp;amp;K UMP 40 caliber submachine gun. The M14 rifle is used for mostly ceremonial purposes. As a less than lethal option, the Border Patrol also uses the FN303. [edit] Transportation Unlike in many other law enforcement agencies in the United States, the Border Patrol operates several thousand SUVs and pickup trucks, which are known for their capabilities to move around in any sort of terrain. This vehicles may have individual revolving lights (strobes or LEDs) and/or light bars and sirens. An extensive modernization drive has ensured that these vehicles are equipped with wireless sets in communication with a central control room. Border Patrol vehicles may also have equipment such as speed radar, breathalyzers, and emergency first aid kits. Some sectors make use of sedans like the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor or the Dodge Charger as patrol cars or high speed &amp;quot;interceptors&amp;quot; on highways. The Border Patrol also operates ATVs, motorcycles, snowmobiles, and small boats in the riverine environment. In 2005, all Border Patrol and ICE aircraft operations were combined under CBP's Office of Air and Marine. All CBP vessel operation in Customs Waters are conducted by Office of Air and Marine. Color schemes of Border Patrol vehicles are either a long green stripe running the length of the vehicle or a broad green diagonal stripe on the door. Most Border Patrol vehicles are painted predominantly white. The Border Patrol also extensively uses horses for remote area patrols. The U.S. Border Patrol has 205 horses As of 2005[update]. Most are employed along the Mexico–United States border. In Arizona, these animals are fed special processed feed pellets so that their wastes do not spread non-native plants in the national parks and wildlife areas they patrol.[19] [edit] Line of duty deaths Total line of duty deaths (since 1904): 105[20] Aircraft accident: 14 Assault: 2 Automobile accident: 28 Drowned: 4 Fall: 4 Gunfire: 30 Gunfire (Accidental): 3 Heart attack: 6 Heat exhaustion: 1 Motorcycle accident: 2 Stabbed: 2 Struck by train: 3 Struck by vehicle: 3 Vehicle pursuit: 2 Vehicular assault: 3 [edit] Armed incursions On August 7, 2008, Mexican troops crossed the border into Arizona and held a U.S. Border Patrol Agent at gunpoint. Agents stationed at Ajo, Arizona said that the Mexican soldiers crossed the border into an isolated area southwest of Tucson and pointed rifles at the agent, who has not been identified. The Mexicans withdrew after other American agents arrived on the scene.[21] [edit] Ramos and Compean In February 2005, Border Patrol Agents Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean were involved in an incident while pursuing a van in Fabens, Texas. The driver, later identified as Aldrete Davila, was shot by Agent Ramos during a scuffle. Davila escaped back into Mexico, and the agents discovered that the van contained a million dollars worth of marijuana (about 750 pounds). None of the agents at the scene orally reported the shooting, including two supervisors. The Department of Homeland Security opened up an internal affairs investigation into the incident.[22] See also [23][24][25] [edit] Criticisms [edit] Ineffective In 2006, a documentary called The Illegal Immigration Invasion[26] linked the scale of illegal immigration into the United States chiefly to the ineffectiveness of the Border Patrol. The film claimed that this is due to the lack of judicial powers of the Border Patrol and the effective hamstringing of the agency by the federal government. The film interviews people that deal with illegal immigration on a daily basis, as well as local citizens living in the border areas. [edit] Allegations of abuse There are allegations of abuse by the United States Border Patrol such as the ones reported by Jesus A. Trevino, that concludes in an article published in the Houston Journal of International Law (2006) with a request to create an independent review commission to oversee the actions of the Border Patrol, and that creating such review board will make the American public aware of the &amp;quot;serious problem of abuse that exists at the border by making this review process public&amp;quot; and that &amp;quot;illegal immigrants deserve the same constitutionally-mandated humane treatment of citizens and legal residents&amp;quot;.[27] In 1998, Amnesty International investigated allegations of ill-treatment and brutality by officers of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and particularly the Border Patrol. Their report said they found indications of human rights violations during 1996, 1997 and early 1998.[28] An article in Social Justice by Michael Huspek, Leticia Jimenez, Roberto Martinez (1998) cites that in December 1997, John Case, head of the INS Office of Internal Audit, announced at a press conference that public complaints to the INS had risen 29% from 1996, with the &amp;quot;vast majority&amp;quot; of complaints emanating from the southwest border region, but that of the 2,300 cases, the 243 cases of serious allegations of abuse were down in 1997. These serious cases are considered to be distinct from less serious complaints, such as &amp;quot;verbal abuse, discrimination, extended detention without cause.&amp;quot;[29] [edit] Corruption Incidences of corruption in the U.S. Border Patrol include: Pablo Sergio Barry, an agent charged with one count of harboring an illegal immigrant, three counts of false statements, and two counts of making a false document.[30] He plead guilty.[31] Christopher E. Bernis, an agent indicted on a charge of harboring an illegal immigrant for nine months while employed as a U.S. Border Patrol agent.[32] Jose De Jesus Ruiz, an agent whose girlfriend was an illegal immigrant, he was put on administrative leave pending an investigation.[32] Oscar Antonio Ortiz, an illegal immigrant[33] who used a fake birth certificate to get into the Border Patrol admitted to smuggling more than 100 illegal immigrants into the U.S., some of them in his government truck,[34] and was helping to smuggle illegal immigrants and charged with conspiring with another agent to smuggle immigrants. An unidentified patrol agent who was recorded on a wire tap stating that he helped to smuggle 30 to 50 immigrants at a time.[33] [edit] National Border Patrol Council National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) is the labor union which represents over 14,000 Border Patrol Agents and support staff. The NBPC was founded in 1968, and its parent organization is the American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO. The NBPC's executive committee is staffed by current and retired Border Patrol Agents and, along with its constituent locals, employs a staff of a dozen attorneys and field representatives. The NBPC is associated with the Peace Officer Research Association of California’s Legal Defense Fund.[35] [edit] National Border Patrol Museum The National Border Patrol Museum is located in El Paso, Texas. The museum exhibits uniforms, equipment, photographs, guns, vehicles, airplanes, boats, and documents which depict the historical and current sector operations throughout the United States.

This statement receives fuller support from announcements emanating from the INS. In December 1997, John Chase, head of the INS Office of Internal Audit, announced at a press conference that public complaints to the INS had risen 29% from 1996, with the &amp;quot;vast majority&amp;quot; of complaints emanating from the southwest border region. Over 2,300 complaints were filed in 1997 as opposed to the 1,813 complaints filed in 1996. Another 400 reports of &amp;quot;minor misconduct&amp;quot; were placed in a new category. Chase was quick to emphasize, however, that the 243 &amp;quot;serious&amp;quot; allegations of abuse and use of excessive force that could warrant criminal prosecution were down in 1997, as compared with the 328 in 1996. These &amp;quot;serious&amp;quot; cases are considered to be distinct from less serious complaints, such as &amp;quot;verbal abuse, discrimination, extended detention without cause. ^ June 23, 2005 &amp;quot;Border agent accused of hiding an illegal entrant&amp;quot;.

<photo  date_taken="2011-11-27 14:51:05" description="The Renaissance Center Detroit, Michigan, USA. On this day, I went out to breakfast and noticed a fog enshrouding the top of the Fisher Building, but I didn't have my camera with me. After breakfast, I went home and got my camera, but then the fog was gone from that building. So, I headed downtown. I noticed a cloud around the Book Tower, but it passed before I found a shooting location. I kept driving around, but the low lying clouds were few and fleeting...except here at the Ren. Cen., by the river. There was a light rain, and I didn't have any protection for my camera, so I just positioned my car and shot through the opened driver's window. When I started shooting, the street lights were on, but they went out after a few shots. I liked the framing of this shot better than the earlier ones, and wasn't sure if the street light glowing would be a distraction or add interest. What do you think?

<photo  date_taken="1974-01-01 00:00:00" description="The Boston-Edison Historic District comprises numerous large, single residence homes, the great majority built between 1900 and 1925. While eclectic in style, they possess a uniformity in roof line, in scale, in set-back from the street, and in the use of stone or brick construction as opposed to frame. These characteristics, in combination with the wide tree-lined streets create and overall ambience of gracious suburban living in a time of slower movement and community interaction." id="5143614478" latitude="42.387141" license="3" longitude="-83.086423" nbComments="0" rank="27" tags="michigan detroit bostonedison history historicpreservation architecture nationalregisterofhistoricplaces shpo" title="William A.
