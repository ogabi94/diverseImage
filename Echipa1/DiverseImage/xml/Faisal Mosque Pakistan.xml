<photo  date_taken="2008-10-04 15:56:33" description="Inside the Shah Faisal Mosque in Islamabad, Pakistan. The Kiblah Wall (seen here with the large tablet Quran in the center) inside the Main Prayer Hall has many decorated glazed tiles from Turkey and a giant golden crescent in the roof. Underneath the wall are reflection pools which allows for air conditioning by adjusting the water level of the pool. There is a giant chandelier in the main prayer hall which weighs some 7.5 tons and uses 1000 electric bulbs. Instead of traditional domes usually associated with mosques, the main prayer hall is an eight faceted concrete representative of a desert tent. An impressive engineering feat, the shell reaches a height of 131'- 3&amp;quot; (40m) and is supported on four giant concrete girders. The surface is faced in white marble and decorated inside with mosaics and a spectacular Turkish style chandelier." id="2913495898" latitude="0" license="2" longitude="0" nbComments="10" rank="6" tags="shahfaisalmosque islamabad pakistan islam muslim chandelier prayerhall" title="Inside the Faisal Mosque" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/3015/2913495898_09287c94a4_b.jpg" username="Swamibu" views="5348" />

<photo  date_taken="2009-12-10 15:18:56" description="My first attempt at post-processing an HDR (created in Photomatix) with GIMP. Its probably a little over processed which resulted in some halos around the minarets. I might also have been a tad too liberal with the unsharp mask. Post processing steps involved a Curves mask layer for contrast and a mask layer for Hue/Saturation (Blue) for the sky.

A Twenty20 game involves two teams, each has a single innings, batting for a maximum of 20 overs. In a time when Pakistani's are disheartened. A country in trouble (again).

Epitomising the beauty, passion and grandeur of the Mughal era, it is Lahore's most famous landmark and a major tourist attraction. Capable of accommodating 5,000 worshippers in its main prayer hall and a further 95,000 in its courtyard and porticoes, it remained the largest mosque in the world from 1673 to 1986 (a period of 313 years), when overtaken in size by the completion of the Faisal Mosque in Islamabad. Today, it remains the second largest mosque in Pakistan and South Asia and the fifth largest mosque in the world after the Masjid al-Haram (Grand Mosque) of Mecca, the Al-Masjid al-Nabawi (Prophet's Mosque) in Medina, the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca and the Faisal Mosque in Islamabad. To appreciate its large size, the four minarets of the Badshahi Mosque are 13.9 ft (4.2 m) taller than those of the Taj Mahal and the main platform of the Taj Mahal can fit inside the 278,784 sq ft (25,899.9 m2) courtyard of the Badshahi Mosque, which is the largest mosque courtyard in the world." id="5925832222" latitude="0" license="4" longitude="0" nbComments="2" rank="78" tags="badshahimosque lahore pakistan punjab" title="Badshahi Mosque, Lahore" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/6023/5925832222_845ebf685c_b.jpg" username="a1245" views="244" />

<photo  date_taken="2010-11-25 09:32:54" description="Ankara's largest mosque was built not that long ago -- it's less than a half century old. This modern-style architecture is apparent at first glance up-close: it has a plaster-look to it rather than the stone/brick look that the wonderful yet ancient Ottoman mosques do in other parts of Turkey. Regardless, the Kocatepe (named after the region in Ankara where it calls home) towers in the center of the city, and can even be seen from the mountains when entering the city -- even at night when I entered since they light it up. The mosque sits atop a tall foundation with a shopping mall and parking garage below -- a very modern approach. The grounds of the Kocatepe Mosque are quite large, it almost felt like a giant maze when I wandered about on the early, cloudy Thanksgiving morning. The interior of the mosque holds four levels of prayers, and there is a separate door that leads a few floors into the ground as well. I nearly got lost. While I was a bit dissapointed with how modern it looked after driving through Turkey from Istanbul and seeing all these gorgeous ancient Ottoman mosques along the way, its size and interior made up for it -- I'll put a panorama of the inside soon... it was jaw-dropping.

<photo  date_taken="2008-10-04 08:55:22" description="The Badshahi Masjid (Urdu: بادشاھی مسجد), was built in 1673 by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb in Lahore, Pakistan. It is one of the city's best known landmarks, and a major tourist attraction epitomising the beauty and grandeur of the Mughal era. Capable of accommodating over 55,000 worshipers, it is the second largest mosque in Pakistan, after the Faisal Mosque in Islamabad. The architecture and design of the Badshahi Masjid is closely related to the Jama Masjid in Delhi, India, which was built in 1648 by Aurangzeb's father and predecessor, emperor Shah Jahan. Badshahi Masjid is one of the locations where Qari' Abdul Basit recited the Qur'an.[citation needed] The Imam-e-Kaaba (Sheikh Abdur-Rahman Al-Sudais of Saudi Arabia) has also led prayers in this mosque in 2007. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badshahi_Masjid&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badshahi_Masjid&lt;/a&gt; Inide view of Badshahi Masjid" id="2930883323" latitude="0" license="1" longitude="0" nbComments="5" rank="90" tags="badshahimasjid historicalbuildings punjab lahore pakistan moughal" title="Badshahi Masjid" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/3144/2930883323_d68df94ff0_b.jpg" username="NotMicroButSoft (Winter Survival - Keran Top Exped" views="980" />
<photo  date_taken="2007-03-28 00:24:30" description="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dawn.com/2004/06/09/local4.htm&quot;&gt;www.dawn.com/2004/06/09/local4.htm&lt;/a&gt; KARACHI, June 8: As many as 1,110 casualties in about 140 blasts in the metropolis have been reported since 1990, the data compiled by Dawn shows. Among the victims, 199 people died in the blasts of varied intensity and 51 of them lost their lives in the last month alone during which the city witnessed some of the worst incidents of bloodshed and violence in a decade. The two suicide bombings - one at the Hyderi mosque and the other at the Imambargah Ali Raza - in May are just next to the only suicide bombing (Nov 6, 2000) reported so far in Karachi, or perhaps in the country. Though there are instances where places of worship had been targeted in the past, the distinguishing factor in the blasts at these particular spots, the mosque and Imambargah, was that the bombs were detonated inside the sacred places. The unprecedented trend sent a wave of shock and anguish among the followers of all sects and the feelings were manifested in the prompt public reaction over the next few days. It was on May 31 that a bomb went off inside the Imambargah Ali Raza on M. A. Jinnah Road while Maghribain prayers were in progress. The blast took a heavy toll killing many faithful on the spot but the figure till date has touched the mark of 24. There were another 30 persons injured in the incident. Initial investigation and evidences make police believe that it was an incident of suicide bombing. The tragedy sparked off widespread violence throughout the city. Just a few days back, on May 26, two car bombs at almost same place - in front of the Pak American Cultural Centre on Fatima Jinnah Road - went off with an interval of about half an hour. A policeman was killed and 30 people, most them press photographers sustained injuries in the incident. The first booby-trap car (Honda City) was blown up with a magnet-bearing bomb that was stuck with the vehicle's body. As police and the mediamen were discharging their duties at the scene, another car parked nearby blew up, killing the police guard of Clifton's TPO. The officer himself was seriously injured along with three press photographers. It transpired that the number plate of the car was fake. On May 25, a parcel bomb exploded in the vicinity of KPT, killing three persons, all labourers, and injured another three. The first suicide bombing had been carried on May 7 during Jumma prayers at the 1894 mosque named Hyderi Masjid. The bomb devastated its main hall as it exploded inside the mosque while faithful were offering prayers. The mosque is located within the historic Sindh Madressatul Islam complex. Fourteen people died and 90 others sustained injuries in the blast. The death toll rose to 23 in the next few days with nine of those injured succumbing to their serious wounds. The first blast of the year had taken place outside Avari Tower building on January 15. Several policemen, Clifton's TPO Munir Shaikh and photographers were among the 12 people injured in the explosion. A grenade had exploded outside the premises of the Holy Trinity Church first, and the devastating blast in a Suzuki (Hi-roof) happened next. On April 10, a young man died when a car blew up near the Golf Club in DHA during a concert where an Indian singer, Sonu Nigum, was performing. The young victim was son of a police official. The first bomb blast of 2003 had taken place on February 3. The bomb went off outside the PSO House in Clifton, killing a fee-collector of charged-parking contractor. In May 2003, there was a series of cracker explosions at 21 petrol stations across the city. Five people were injured. On July 22, 2003, two persons died when a bomb went off at the entrance of the Kawish Crown Plaza on Sharea Faisal. On September 22, 2003, another explosion rocked the 10th floor of the same plaza without causing any casualties. It is noted that terrorists in the past had been using hand grenades to cause a blast and the explosives in most cases appeared to be of Russian origin. The grenades were hurled at the targets, including mosques, Imambargahs, police stations, etc. However, in the recent incidents of bomb blast, locally made explosives are being used. In their apparent bid to cause maximum possible number of casualties and highest amount of scare, terrorists select crowded and secured places like major hospitals, places of worship, police stations, etc., as their target. During the past few decades, the city courts, stock exchange building and newspapers offices in the city also came under attack. Explosive devices used to be planted in garbage dumps and junk shops in many incidents whereas in some cases time bombs and plastic explosives weighing one-two kilograms, attached with detonator, were used. A similar device had gone off outside the office of the district East police chief on May 5, 2000 leaving one person dead and six others injured. In the blast which took place on Sept 24, 1999, a home-made pipe bomb was used to cause a blast outside the civil hospital. Several vehicles parked outside the hospital were damaged. In several incidents minors playing outside their houses in different localities of the city were injured when they picked up or touched a booby-trap device. One of the most vulnerable targets selected once by terrorists appeared to be public transport means. Bombs were placed or concealed in mini-buses plying on busy routes to cause heavy casualties and damage. Some of the major incidents of bomb blasts since 1990 included the series of explosion in the city on October 10, 1991. Four persons were killed and 50 others injured in the blasts at four sensitive and strategic points. The powerful devices went off one after the other within a radius of two kilometres. The first blast occurred at the Central Police Office followed by those at the Sindh Secretariat, CIA Centre (Saddar) and the old KDA building opposite Burnes Garden. On August 18, 1992, three Navy personnel were killed and 43 injured when three hand-grenades, allegedly in possession of one of the victims, exploded in the passenger enclosure of Keamari. Two Bangladeshi immigrants were killed and five others injured when a home-made bomb went off, in a junk dealer shop in Moosa Goth, North Nazimabad, on Oct 10, 1992. About a month later, two persons were killed and 16 injured when two high-intensity explosions ripped through the usually crowded Urdu Bazaar on November 12, 1992. In most unusual modus operandi, attackers used a parcel bomb which killed superintendent of the Central Jail Karachi Khalid Iqbal. He died on the spot upon opening the parcel delivered through a courier at his residence on March 15, 1993. Terrorists lobbed a grenade at a bus in North Karachi, killing six people and injuring 22 of the 45 passengers, who were returning from an Imambargah located at Sindhi Hotel area and were on their way to Qasba Colony on July 23, 1994. Ten people were killed and 28 others injured when a powerful bomb exploded outside a mosque after Jumma prayers in Malir on March 3, 1995. On April 30, 1995, a projectile exploded at a junk dealer's shop in SITE, claiming four lives. The then Bomb Disposal Squad chief, Mr Moinuddin, had described the device as 'heat projectile shell' similar to an infantry heat HMX-TNT (84mm) rocket. A 60-year-old sweeper died when a home-made crude bomb went off in her hands in Kalakot area on Sept 9, 1995. The victim, Rehmat Bibi, was sweeping Barkati Compound in the locality when she found a garbage bag containing the explosive device. The city had witnessed a spate of rocket attacks in the '90s also but no major loss of life or property had occurred in the incident. On June 1, 1995, two rockets were fired at the New Karachi police station. Two policemen were slightly injured. On the same day, two powerful blasts rocked the Sindh Assembly and Naval Colony. Seven rockets hit the Sindh Secretariat building destroying several offices. Though the attack caused much damage to the building, it did not cause casualties. On Nov 14, 1995, 10 (RPG) rockets were fired at the district South police offices. Most of the rockets missed their targets. One of the attackers was killed in a shootout with police. On Jan 8, 1996, a powerful bomb ripped through a jampacked bus on Sharea Faisal, killing seven passengers and wounding 35 others. The ill-fated bus had started its journey from Saddar and was heading towards Gulshan-i-Hadeed when the blast occurred. A powerful bomb exploded outside the offices of an Urdu daily on March 4, 1997. No major casualties were reported. On Nov 2, 1997, principal of the Jamiatul Uloom Al-Islamiyya, Binnori Town, Dr Habibullah Mukhtar and one of his colleagues were burnt to death when two motorcycles hurled an explosive device in their vehicle at Business Recorder Road. Seven persons were killed and 26 injured when a powerful bomb exploded in a shop at Al-Asif Square near Sohrab Goth. Two persons were injured when two locally-made explosive devices, one planted in daily Dawn's office and the other under a car in front of the nearby Saifee House, went off with an interval of about half-an-hour. Two passenger were killed and 18 others injured when a time bomb exploded in a Korangi-bound bus near Mehmoodabad on Oct 8, 1999. Nine persons were killed and 25 others injured when a bomb planted in a sugarcane juice shop at the intersection of Shahrah-i-Liaquat and Mohammad Hashim Khan Road, near Aram Bagh, went off on Jan 1, 2000. Three persons were killed and 23 injured when a blast rocked the convention organized by a jihadi outfit in Gulshan-i-Iqbal on Oct 22, 2000. On Nov 6, 2000, the first ever suspected suicide bombing took place at the office of Nawa-i-Waqt and The Nation near Guru Mandir roundabout. Investigators had said: &amp;quot;A woman having fastened a belt around her waist to hold the bomb went into the newspaper's office and detonated the device.&amp;quot; Her body blew up in pieces whereas two of the newspaper employees also died in the blast. Later, experts came out with the theory that the woman might have been trapped by the attackers who detonated the remote-controlled device. The first blast of 2002 had taken place on the New Year night injuring eight persons at Area-51 near Marina Club, DHA. Several vehicles parked inside the club were damaged in the explosion. During early months of the same year, a new technology was used by the terrorists who used two mobile phone sets to detonate a parcel bomb sent to a retired army official and delivered at his residence in Clifton. Experts said that one of the mobile phones was used to play the ring, the second one, attached with some explosive substance, to detonate the device. As the parcel exploded, there was nobody present in the room where driver of the army official had placed it. On May 8, 2002, fourteen people, including 11 Frenchmen, were killed and 18 others injured by a suicide bomber who pulled up his car near the Pakistan Navy's bus carrying the Frenchmen. The blast occurred in front of the Sheraton Hotel on Club Road. The suicide bomber was driving a 1981 Corolla which was blown into pieces. On June 14, 2002, 10 people died and 51 injured when a vehicle blew up in front of the US Consulate causing massive destruction. Initially, it was believed that a vehicle carrying four women and belonging to a driving institute was the actual booby-trap. However, foreign investigation agencies later came out with the theory that the bomb was planted in another vehicle, a Suzuki pick-up, which was being driven by two men. On Dec 4, 2002, a blast occurred at the residence of the honorary consul of Macedonia. It caused widespread damage within the vicinity. On Dec 19, 2002, four people died when an explosion took place in a house in Korangi. The Sindh IGP had told newsmen that one of the most wanted terrorists with international links, Asif Ramzi, was among the four." id="436713420" latitude="0" license="3" longitude="0" nbComments="4" rank="91" tags="paintings fantasy surrealist abstraction painting httpwwwdawncom20040609local4htm bombblastinkarachi" title="Bomb blast in Karachi" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/177/436713420_5e7dc321df_b.jpg" username="Dr.S.Ali Wasif" views="4424" />

<photo  date_taken="2011-03-10 18:20:43" description="Representative Peter King (R-NY), Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, finds himself at the center of a media-created firestorm — all because he wants to investigate the extent to which some American Muslims have been radicalized and examine how cooperative the Muslim community has been in rooting out extremists in their midst. Why this has developed into such a wildly controversial matter says more about those who are threatening, smearing, and hysterically criticizing King than it does about radical Islam. When the left allies itself with extremist groups like the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) in order to wave the flag of political correctness in America’s face, you realize that the problem is bigger than simply rooting out extremism. The exaggerated, over-the-top, self-righteous posturing coming from media outlets like The New York Times bespeaks a refusal to face up to the challenge of radical Islam in America and how to combat it. And if we’re not prepared to address the threat of extremism in our own country, how can we possibly fight it overseas? Leftists and their Muslim grievance-monger allies are deliberately seeking to block efforts to discover the extent of the problem of terrorism by viciously attacking the New York congressman. They are opposing King in the name of some misguided belief that because terrorism comes from a specific religious group, we must blind ourselves to the danger, else we would be guilty of “bigotry.” The hearings aren’t about bigotry. Nor are they about the Muslim faith. They are about a danger that President Obama, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, and Attorney General Eric Holder have all talked about recently: domestically recruited and radicalized terrorists. It’s not as if we have no examples of this phenomenon and King is just making stuff up as he goes along. There is a man sitting in the desert in Yemen right now — a man born and raised in the United States — who has inspired and radicalized American Muslims like the Fort Hood shooter Major Nidal Hasan and served as a “spiritual advisor” to 3 of the 9/11 hijackers. Anwar al-Awlaki preached at a mosque in San Diego for years before moving to Falls Church, Virginia. There, his anti-American sermons and calls for jihad against the West fell on receptive ears. Not only Nidal Hasan answered his call to violence, but it is suspected that 5 young American Muslims from Virginia, arrested in Pakistan as they were seeking to perhaps join al-Qaeda, were also under the spell of the radical cleric. His video sermons have inspired others, such as Faisal Shahzad, who attempted to bomb Times Square, and the Christmas Day bomber, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab. In fact, the list of radicalized, home-grown terrorists is a long one. The question isn’t why we are looking at the problem, but why anyone in their right mind would oppose the effort in the first place? The attacks on Rep. King are as vicious as they are unfair. The New York Times, in an editorial dripping with self-righteousness, blatantly calls him a bigot. Says the Times: ”His refusal to tone down the provocation despite widespread opposition suggests that he is far more interested in exploiting ethnic misunderstanding than in trying to heal it.” In fact, the Times won’t even grant King the benefit of the doubt regarding any radicalization of Muslims in America. It editorializes, “Mr. King, a Republican whose district is centered in Nassau County on Long Island, says the hearings will examine the supposed radicalization of American Muslims.” The “supposed” radicalization of American Muslims? This is the CAIR position lock, stock, and barrel. The unindicted co-conspirators in the Holy Land Foundation trial promote the idea that Americans mistake extremists for devout Muslims and that preaching jihad against the West doesn’t necessarily mean that violence is being promoted. Any effort to say otherwise is met with cries of “Islamophobia” or “racism.” In an article in the New York Daily News on February 28, CAIR accused King of all sorts of vile offenses, including “hold[ing] hearings on the alleged ‘radicalization’ of American Muslims” and lying about the lack of cooperation between the Muslim community and law enforcement when it comes to terrorism investigations. Despite CAIR’s caterwauling, police and federal agents confirm King’s assertion. A New York Daily News article quoted local and federal law enforcement officials declaring that King was right about the lack of cooperation from Muslims in terror investigations, although they also point to similar attitudes toward tipping police from other ethnic communities. The point being, CAIR is wrong and they know it. Their goal is not to improve communication between Muslims and the FBI, but rather to stoke the flames of distrust so that their people see a greater need for a “Muslim civil rights group” to protect them from the police and the Feds. As you would think, the most exaggerated invective directed against King comes from the hysterical left, which as never met a conservative unfit for Hitler comparisons, or, in the case of King, a paranoid Islamophobe. Senator Harry Reid led the charge against King on Capitol Hill. The Majority Leader assured us of his terrorism fighting credentials by letting us know that he supports hunting down terrorists and “bringing them to justice wherever they live.” But Reid is “deeply concerned” about the hearings “which demonize law-abiding American Muslims who make important contributions to our society.” In fact, Reid is as concerned as he would be “about Congressional hearings to investigate Catholics, Jews or people of any other faith based solely on their religion.” Note that Reid completely misrepresents the goal of the hearings. Muslims are not being “investigated.” Islam is not on trial. I’m sure if Catholics carried out hundreds of terror attacks that King would find time to investigate the extremism that drove them to commit such acts as well. But the left can’t bear to have their morally relative universe shaken in this way. So, like patting down 90 year old grandmothers at airports, we must also investigate other religions, other sources of domestic terror. Then it would be “fair.” Then it would be “acceptable.” The liberal columnists are even more hysterically overwrought over this common-sense approach to terrorism (that actually looks at those who perpetrate 95% of terrorist attacks). The Washington Post’s Richard Cohen doesn’t see what all the fuss is about. He points to a study that reports that domestic terrorism went down last year; from 47 suspects in 2009 to “only” 20 in 2010. Nothing to see here, move along. If one were to take only a percentage of religious adherents who plan terrorist attacks, Cohen would be right. It took “only” 21 terrorists to kill 3,000 Americans. The problem isn’t in numbers, but intent. Cohen also raises the Catholic canard by weirdly comparing terrorism to the sex crimes of priests: “The government has no business examining any peaceful religious group because a handful of adherents have broken the law. If it did, it would be past time to look into the Roman Catholic Church, which clearly was – or maybe still is – concealing the sex crimes of priests and others.” Is priestly misconduct equivalent to murdering dozens, hundreds — thousands? Cohen apparently believes this to be true. Another Washington Post columnist, Eugene Robinson, accuses King of stoking “irrational fears” and writes, “King offers no support for his insinuation that Muslim Americans are giving aid and comfort to terrorists; to the contrary, Muslim clerics and worshipers in this country have been vocal in their rejection of jihadist rhetoric and violence.” King makes no such insinuation that American Muslims are “giving aid and comfort” to terrorists. That’s a monumental exaggeration and proves that Robinson, like most of the left, doesn’t care about what King is actually trying to accomplish with the hearings, but rather it is that he is holding the hearings in the first place. The witness list for the hearings includes Rep. Keith Ellison, the first Muslim-American elected to Congress, as well as relatives of those who were radicalized in American mosques and a Los Angeles County sheriff who will testify about the extensive cooperation he has received from the Muslim community. It should be obvious to even the most partisan of King’s critics that he is bending over backward to be fair. King has asked for extra security because of the death threats. But he seems undeterred. In fact, he is genuinely puzzled at the reaction from the left. “What are they afraid of?” he asks. “What are they hiding from? Why are they attacking me in such a rabid way?” Perhaps in through the representative’s hearings we will find out.
