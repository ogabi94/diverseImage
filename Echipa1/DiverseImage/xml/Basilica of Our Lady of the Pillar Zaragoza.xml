Still preserved Romanesque sculptures inside the apse, but now it is hidden by the Gothic altarpiece. In the sacristy , is displayed the &amp;quot; oliphant &amp;quot;carved ivory Gaston of Bearn , the eleventh century , and reliquaries busts San Valero (pattern of Zaragoza), San Vicente and San Lorenzo donated by the antipope Benedict XIII . Jewels of ribs inside the gothic vaults of the cathedral. Gothic : fourteenth century Gothic-Mudejar bill, especially in the higher bodies of the apse and in the funeral chapel of San Miguel or &amp;quot;Parroquieta&amp;quot; which houses the tomb of Archbishop Don Lope Fernandez de Luna , also Gothic. The temple covers ships and also maintain this style throughout various extensions from the fourteenth century to the sixteenth . The fifteenth century choir stalls dating and the magnificent altarpiece greater polychrome alabaster made ​​by Pere Johan and Hans of Swabia , which is considered a masterpiece of late Gothic Europe. The Tapestry Museum Flemish houses fabrics fourteenth to eighteenth centuries, and is considered one of the top three collections in the world. Mudéjar : as mentioned before, is present in the apse, the outer wall and the roof Parroquieta gilded wood. Beautifully crafted and good proportions is the current dome that crowns the transept of the cathedral and illuminates the sanctuary, made in the sixteenth century, somewhere between the late Gothic-Mudejar and Renaissance style emerging. The Aragonese Mudejar has been declared a World Heritage Site . Renaissance : notably the choir with its chapels, and the Chapel of San Bernardo, carved in alabaster, the Archangels and San Pedro Arbués, all in style Catholic Monarchs . The reforms sponsored by Hernando de Aragón turned SEO in a church hall or Hallenkirche plant, consisting of five naves of equal height, covered by vaults suggestive, ranging from single vault, through calls terceletes, until ribbed starry fruit called Flamboyant Gothic or end. The vaults resting on slender pillars fasciculate, crowned with capitals with decorative plants and the oldest heraldic toes of the cathedral were already made in the sixteenth century. Baroque : the bell tower of the Cathedral , which was designed by the Italian architect Giovanni Battista Contini . The facade next to the tower, which is currently considered the main temple, but actually corresponds to the access arm of the transept, shows a baroque-influenced neoclassical . We also noticed some chapels decoration and interior covers mostly the same. [ edit ]History Main article: History of the Cathedral of the Savior of Zaragoza . [ edit ]Origins The lot on which sits the Cathedral was the religious center of old city. There stood the main temple Caesaraugusta the old forum Roman archeological shows whose eponymous museum is located underground in the Cathedral Square. Unlike other temples of Roman cities, was not built at the confluence of the thistle and decumano , but the banks of the Ebro , adjacent to the river port. From the third century the decline of the city led to their re their noblest materials. From mid-century documents the Christianization of the city, which became episcopal Visigothic cathedral equipped headquarters. However it is not known the exact location of the late Roman cathedral dedicated to San Vicente , although the finding of a Visigothic cancel the solar Seo suggests that could be located there. [ edit ]The mosque Abdallah ben Hanas as San'ani (d. 718 ), disciple of one of the relatives of Muhammad , was the builder, between the years 714 and 716 of the mosque more than Saraqusta to Baida , &amp;quot;the White Zaragoza&amp;quot; tells us al-Humauydí ( 1029 - 1095 ). If true, the mosque would be one of the oldest in Al-Andalus . In several Arab chronicles are collected traditions attributed fixation mihrab in the eastern wall, where today stands the chapel of St. Peter Arbués, as a niche carved from a single block of white marble, alabaster perhaps as al-Zuhri and anonymous chronicle: [The mihrab is sculpted] from a single block of white marble that is unparalleled throughout the ecumene al-Zuhri This mihrab is a block of white marble hollowed one piece with a master amazing and wonderful art, above which was placed a perfectly formed shell, around the world there is no such mihrab anonymous Arabic chronicle This original mosque, occupying an area of ​​35 x 44 m west-east (the main entrance to the mosque was in the same place as that of the present cathedral) are preserved only foundation remains, and an element of great importance: the trace of the mihrab. The original mosque consist of an open courtyard (sahn) and a covered prayer hall with five aisles perimeter walls supported on blocks of alabaster. The building underwent two expansions, one of the mid- ninth century ( 856 ) and second, attested in 1023 , under King Taifa of Zaragoza Mundir I . The first regrowth is due to political heyday Musa ibn Musa , and was undertaken with the spoils of a aceifa waged against the Barcelona region. Consisted of the addition of two vessels to each side, for a total of nine and widening the yard reaching an area of ​​56 x 44 meters. Because legend and importance of the mihrab, remained in its original position, which was somewhat offset from the axis of the temple. The second extension of Mundhir I , and as independent taifa king of Saraqusta, endowed the mosque with an area of 54 x 86 meters with the eastward enlargement of almost twice the original length, which became one of the the largest in Al-Andalus. This involved moving the mihrab block digging the foundations and moving on rollers, complicated operation that caused cracks in pieza.También minaret erected a large, bell tower become Mudejar , lasted until the seventeenth century, when it was demolished and replaced by the current baroque tower . During the restoration, completed in 1999 , many vestiges have been discovered, such as the floor of the old building and the imprint of the minaret in the outer walls, which had allowed its original appearance . [ edit ]The Romanesque cathedral Romanesque central apse window (second half of the twelfth century). The entry in 1118 of Alfonso I the Battler in Zaragoza, did not mean the immediate demolition of the mosque. It took a year to settle extramural Muslims and from 1119 until October 4th of 1121 , the year the building was consecrated and dedicated to San Salvador , were made ​​necessary reforms to bring the temple to the Christian celebrations. The new cathedral ( one thousand one hundred and sixty-six - one thousand one hundred ninety-eight ) starts under the protection and patronage of the bishop of Zaragoza Pedro Tarroja . First shifted the axis of the Romanesque cathedral in a north-south (facing west-east of the mosque) and were demolished eleven sections of the ships becoming Muslim in the courtyard cloister , moving the main entrance to the south side, where today is the Pabostría door. And joined in the precincts of the mosque (in the manner as in the Mosque of Cordoba ) a hall church without apses and transept which stood not on the side walls. The nave was very wide compared to the side, much closer, as in San Pedro de Rodas and San Salvador de Leyre . It was covered with a wooden roof and two sides kept the minaret of the mosque converted into a belfry. Despite being a provisional work, the building remained in this state until the late twelfth century . The construction of the apses and a cover flanked by two towers not be undertaken until 1166 . The new work, a basilica with transept and three naves completed in five apses (three semicircular central square flanked by two), lasted until 1198 , and owes much in his style to the Cathedral of Jaca , which takes various elements. Besides the church, the building ended up owning file, refectory, infirmary and two cloisters . From this time the body is still preserved below the apse, with windows flanked by two columns with decorated capitals and archivolts adorned with the call checkered jaqués abroad. Inside houses a collection of sculptures that are currently hidden behind the main altarpiece. This header is akin to that of Tudela Cathedral , built in the same period. Also completed in the second half of the twelfth century the front of the feet of the church, built on the south wall of the mosque building on the open door of a chamber of Islamic oratory. In the archaeological excavation of 1994 was discovered the foundations of the cover in a place near the present choir, flared plant, a light of 2.85 meters and two square towers flanking both sides. The Romanesque facade modeled after that of Saint Pierre de Moissac. This cover and the towers were not demolished until 1549 . Also sculptural remains have been found of elderly musicians Revelation and a lion, bringing the tympanum showing Christ between Tetramorph surrounded by the cycle of the 24 elders of Revelation , that is, the Christ of the Second Coming or Parousia . The set should be similar to the tympanum of the west portal of the abbey church of Saint Pierre de Moissac in 1130 . From 1204 until the fifteenth century are crowned in the church all kings of Aragon by a privilege granted by Pope Innocent III . The king, who had watched the night before their weapons in the Aljafería , was coming from there in procession. The ceremony had four parts: investiture of weapons, anointing with holy oil, imposition of the crown and the royal insignia and oath of the privileges and liberties of the Kingdom of Aragon before a Gothic cross gold and precious stones that always kept this cathedral jealously as a very precious jewel. The last king to be crowned in the Cathedral was Charles I of Aragon . From him, the Kings only have to swear the charters. The cathedral also celebrated baptisms, weddings and royal burials. [ edit ]The Gothic cathedral and Moorish Detail of the west portal of the fourteenth century Moorish, disappeared almost entirely after the construction of the Baroque façade. In the center depicts the heraldic emblem of the moon. In 1318 Pope John XXII created the archbishop of Zaragoza , freeing the seat of Tarragona , bringing the building became metropolitan cathedral. From that time extensions will be made using materials available in this geographical area and traditionally used by Moorish craftsmen: the brick and plaster. Under the supervision of Archbishop Pedro Lopez de Luna ( 1 317 - one thousand three hundred and forty-five ) building a three-nave Gothic church that keeps the apses Romanesque. The nave will be higher than the side windows would open in 1447 will incorporate windows . In 1346 it began a dome Mudejar to give birth to the header with the participation of teachers Juan de Barbastro and Sunday Serrano , who was replaced by a more slender in 1520 . In 1360 , during the archbishopric of Lope Fernandez de Luna , stands the main facade of the Pabostría that, except for some debris, has not survived. The archbishop himself commanded to build a chapel dedicated to St. Michael, the call &amp;quot;Parroquieta&amp;quot; all in Mudejar style. It is a narrow rectangular space that is inserted as a closed and independent chapel inside the building and that Don Lope projected as his funerary chapel. Construction has already started in 1374 by Miguel del Cellero , is a unique example of the work of teachers Aragonese and builders Seville, which upholstered outer wall with geometric smooth and glazed brick. The culmination of the work in 1376 resulted in a Gothic cathedral spacious and better lit. In 1403 the old dome ruin. The Antipope Benedict XIII , Pope Luna, Aragonese by birth, a new reform will boost building. Romanesque apses were raised and made ​​a new dome-shaped tiara papal. Decorated in 1409 by master Mohammed Rami , could be seen by Benedict XIII in his visit to the city in 1410 . The altarpiece was greater during the pontificate of Don Dalmau de Mur and Cervelló ( 1,431 - one thousand four hundred and fifty-six ), and is one of the best examples of Gothic sculpture in Europe. This archbishop focused on beautifying the interior of the building, commissioning, and the high altar, the choir stalls, windows for lighting the nave, the former home of the Pabostría and other minor actions. [ edit ]The Renaissance turbulent On September 14 of 1485 was murdered in the cathedral the first Inquisitor of Aragon Pedro Arbués (posted to the altars by Pope Pius IX in 1867 ) while praying and mesh helmet protected. The incident was a result of the bad reception he had the Inquisition in Aragon, which was seen as an attack on the crown to the charters . In particular, it appears that some of the most powerful families of Jewish converts like Sanchez, Montesa, the Paternoy or Santángel, knowing targeted victims of the Inquisition, were involved in the assassination. As a result there was a popular uprising against Jews and finally 'nine executed, in person, apart from two suicides, thirteen burned in effigy and four punished for complicity' account as Jerónimo Zurita . The tomb of the saint, by Gil Morlanes father is in the building, in the chapel of San Pedro Arbués. Detail Table View of Zaragoza in 1647, by JB Martínez del Mazo , sometimes attributed to his teacher, Velázquez . Milestones represented correspond to: 1 - Dome of the Cathedral 2 - Mudejar tower of the Cathedral 3 - Palace of the Delegation of the United 4 - Lonja 5 - Stone Bridge. Over the centuries XV and XVI many of the Archbishops of Zaragoza were members of the House of Aragon . Were: Juan I of Aragon (c. 1440 - 1475 ) illegitimate son of John II of Aragon . During his tenure he built a new body and was sent to replace in altarpiece three major scenes in wood by other alabaster polychromed. Alonso II of Aragon ( 1470 or 1478 - 1520 ) illegitimate son Ferdinand . He added a ship by hand, from the cathedral to have three to five ships and have all raised to the height of the nave. The old dome, which threatened ruin since 1417 was badly damaged by the collapse of one of the pillars that held in 1498 . He instructed Juan Botero building a new dome, also Mudejar shaped eight-pointed star, which can still be seen from the vaults of the church. Between 1505 and 1520 the work was performed, which was completed by his son and successor, Don Juan de Aragon, bishop from 1520 to 1531 . Hernando de Aragón ( one thousand four hundred ninety-eight - 1 575 ), the illegitimate son of the former and Dona Ana de Gurrea . Archbishop since 1539 , was one of the most influential people of the kingdom of Aragon. Great patron and promoter of the arts, directed the recent enlargement of the cathedral between 1547 and 1550 , adding two feet to complete sections. The expansion was initially commissioned Juan de Segura , but finally ran Mendibe Charles , who added the two sections of the feet to the five ships with their new side chapels, two on each side side, and four more in the background. Between 1549 and 1555 the archbishop sent his conduct in alabaster tomb to Juan Vizcaino and his mother, Anne of Gurrea , to Juan de Liceire , in the new chapel of San Bernardo . The altarpiece of the chapel of San Bruno, which commissioned the sculptor Pedro de Moreto . [ edit ]The last centuries The old confrontation between the canons of Pilar and the Seo was notorious in the seventeenth century . So much so, that the council of Pilar filed a lawsuit to obtain the episcopal, lawsuit which was solved by Felipe IV in favor of Seo. Disputes will not be solved until in 1676 Pope Clement X decided in a Solomonic and the Bull of Union melt both councils. Seo In June reside dignities and 15 canons, as in the Pilar, and the dean would live six months in each. Also in the seventeenth century was demolished the old Moorish tower, very poor, and began construction of a new one. The new Baroque bell tower , designed by Juan Bautista Contini in Rome in 1683 , was begun in 1686 and finished in 1704 with the placement of the spire , culminating his ninety feet high. The new facade was classical baroque style by architect Julian Yarza between 1763 and 1767 at the request of Archbishop Francisco Ignacio Anoa and Bust . On the front door of the Archbishop shows the coat and left lateral Anoa gives access to the chapel of San Miguel, popularly called &amp;quot;The Parroquieta '. Between 1960 and 1965 were judged produced a series of thefts in the library of the Cathedral, one of the largest in Europe. was found to have disappeared about 583 books, manuscripts, incunabula and manuscripts, with a value of 13,295,500 pesetas of the time. The main cause was the apathy with which the library had been treated since the mid-nineteenth century by the council, which greatly facilitated the work of thieves as Ry Ferrajoli Enzo , an Italian born in Naples in 1913, with impeccable credentials and many connections within the Franco regime , which seized about 110 books. So just could recover a volume from the Complutense Polyglot Bible and maniples curatorum , long considered the first book published in Spain. The rest, of which he was such a book dedicated to Aragon and signed by Juan de Coloma , secretary of Ferdinand, on January 2, 1492, the day of the taking of Granada , ended up in various places, such as the British Museum and Yale University or auctioned by Sotheby's , who refused to return them, arguing that they had bought in good faith, by standard procedures and people you trust. In the second half of the twentieth century there was a deep renovation of the building that lasted about 23 years. The project can be divided into four stages: from 1975 to 1987 : replacement of the six pillars of the nave, roofs, eaves, windows, foundation, demolition and excavation adjacent buildings. from 1987 to 1992 : Parroquieta wall, dome, chapels header and neoclassical facade. from 1992 to 1994 : completion of earlier and excavation of Roman and Muslim remains. from 1995 to 1998 : restoration of the tower, spire and clock, the body, the high altar, in general all plasterwork and chapels were cleaned and restored, also adjusted the tapestry museum. In total they spent more than two billion pesetas , paid by Government of Aragon , the Archbishop of Zaragoza and the Metropolitan Council, the Ministry of Education and Culture, Ibercaja and Savings Bank of the Immaculate.

The Basilica-Cathedral of Our Lady of the Pillar (in Spanish Catedral-Basílica de Nuestra Señora del Pilar) is a Roman Catholic church in the city of Zaragoza, Aragon in Spain. The Basilica venerates Mary the mother of Jesus, under her title Our Lady of the Pillar praised as Mother of the Hispanic Peoples by Pope John Paul II. It is reputed to be the first church dedicated to Mary in history. Local traditions take the history of this basilica to the dawn of Christianity in Spain attributing to an apparition to St James the greater, an Apostle who had brought Christianity to the country.[4] This is the only known apparition of Mary to have occurred before her Assumption.[2] Many of the kings of Spain, many other foreign rulers and saints have paid their devotion before this statue of Mary. St. John of the Cross, St. Teresa of Avila, St. Ignatius of Loyola, and Blessed William Joseph Chaminade are among the most outstanding ones.[5] The Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar is one of two minor basilicas in the city of Zaragoza, and is co-cathedral of the city alongside the nearby La Seo Cathedral.
