<photo  date_taken="2010-12-17 13:50:51" description="In its early days, Flagstaff's economic base comprised the lumber, railroad, and ranching industries. Today, that has largely been replaced by tourism, education, government, and transportation. Some of the larger employers in Flagstaff are Northern Arizona University, the Flagstaff Medical Center, and the Flagstaff Unified School District. Tourism is a large contributor to the economy, as the city receives over 5 million visitors per year. Scientific and high tech research and development operations are located in the city, including the Lowell Observatory, Northern Arizona University, the United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station (NOFS) and the United States Geological Survey's (USGS) Flagstaff campus. Lowell Observatory continues to be an active astronomical observatory and a popular visitors center which hosts educational displays and tours. It has a distributed network of small telescopes which together create images of celestial bodies with much higher resolutions than any other single telescope can produce. Current research is involved in observations of near-Earth phenomena such as asteroids and comets. The observatory is also involved in a $30 million project with the Discovery Channel to build the Discovery Channel Telescope, a sophisticated, ground-based telescope with advanced optical capabilities for future projects. Lowell Observatory and NOFS are also collaborators on the major project, the Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer, on nearby Anderson Mesa. NOFS is heavily involved with the science of star catalogs and astrometry, or the positions and distances of stars and celestial objects. There are five industrial parks in the city, situated near I-40 and I-17. Major manufacturers in Flagstaff include W.L. Gore &amp;amp; Associates, widely known as the maker of Gore-Tex; Nestlé Purina PetCare, manufacturer of pet food; SCA Tissue, a major tissue paper producer; and Joy Cone, manufacturer of ice cream cones. Walgreens also operates a distribution center in the city. With proximity to Grand Canyon National Park, the city also has a thriving travel and tourism industry, with numerous hotel and restaurant chains. The downtown area is home to two historic hotels, the Weatherford Hotel and the Hotel Monte Vista. The first hotel of the Ramada Inn chain opened in 1954 at the intersection of U.S. Route 66, 89 and 89A adjacent to what was then Arizona State College (now Northern Arizona University). &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagstaff,_Arizona&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagstaff,_Arizona&lt;/a&gt;" id="5271348658" latitude="35.198653" license="5" longitude="-111.647475" nbComments="0" rank="9" tags="coconino flagstaff arizona" title="Federal Building, Flagstaff, Arizona" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/5285/5271348658_c7b43235d0_b.jpg" username="Ken Lund" views="354" />

<photo  date_taken="2010-12-17 13:51:03" description="In 1855, Lieutenant Edward Fitzgerald Beale surveyed a road from the Rio Grande in New Mexico to Fort Tejon in California, and camped near the current location of Flagstaff. The lieutenant had his men cut the limbs from a straight Ponderosa Pine tree in order to fly the United States flag. The first permanent settlement was in 1876, when Thomas F. McMillan built a cabin at the base of Mars Hill on the west side of town. During the 1880s, Flagstaff began to grow, opening its first post office and attracting the railroad industry. The early economy was based on timber, sheep, and cattle. By 1886, Flagstaff was the largest city on the railroad line between Albuquerque and the west coast of the United States. In 1894, Massachusetts astronomer Percival Lowell hired A. E. Douglass to scout an ideal site for a new observatory. Douglass, impressed by Flagstaff's elevation, named it as an ideal location for the now famous Lowell Observatory, saying: &amp;quot;other things being equal, the higher we can get the better.&amp;quot; Two years later, the specially-designed 24-inch (610 mm) Clark telescope that Lowell had ordered was installed. In 1930, Pluto was discovered using one of the observatory’s telescopes. In 1955 the U.S. Naval Observatory joined the growing astronomical presence, and established the United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station, where Pluto's satellite, Charon (moon) was discovered in 1978. The city grew rapidly, primarily attributable to its location along the east-west transcontinental railroad line in the United States. In the 1880s, the railroads purchased land in the west from the federal government, which was then sold to individuals to help finance the railroad projects. By the 1890s, Flagstaff found itself located along one of the busiest railroad corridors in the U.S., with 80-100 trains travelling through the city every day, destined for Chicago, Los Angeles, and elsewhere. Route 66 was completed in 1926 and ran through Flagstaff. Flagstaff was incorporated as a city in 1928, and in 1929, the city's first motel, the Motel Du Beau, was built at the intersection of Beaver Street and Phoenix Avenue. The Daily Sun described the motel as &amp;quot;a hotel with garages for the better class of motorists.&amp;quot; The units originally rented for $2.60 to $5.00 each, with baths, toilets, double beds, carpets, and furniture. Flagstaff went on to become a popular tourist stop along Route 66, particularly due to its proximity to the Grand Canyon. Flagstaff grew and prospered through the 1960s. During the 1970s and 1980s, however, many businesses started to move from the city center, and the downtown area entered an economic and social decline. Sears and J.C. Penney left the downtown area in 1979 to open up as anchor stores in the new Flagstaff Mall, joined in 1986 by Dillard's. By 1987, the Babbitt Brothers Trading Company, which had been a retail fixture in Flagstaff since 1891, had closed its doors at Aspen Avenue and San Francisco Street. In 1987, the city drafted a new master plan, also known as the Growth Management Guide 2000, which would transform downtown Flagstaff from a shopping and trade center into a regional center for finance, office use, and government. The city built a new city hall, library, and the Coconino County Administrative Building in the downtown district, staking an investment by the local government for years to come. In 1992, the city hired a new manager, Dave Wilcox, who had previously worked at revitalizing the downtown areas of Beloit, Wisconsin and Missoula, Montana. During the 1990s, the downtown area underwent a revitalization, many of the city sidewalks were repaved with decorative brick facing, and a different mix of shops and restaurants opened up to take advantage of the area's historical appeal. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagstaff,_Arizona&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagstaff,_Arizona&lt;/a&gt;" id="5270741811" latitude="35.198193" license="5" longitude="-111.647679" nbComments="0" rank="12" tags="arizona" title="Downtown Flagstaff, Arizona" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/5282/5270741811_5c964472d2_b.jpg" username="Ken Lund" views="281" />

<photo  date_taken="2010-12-17 13:25:45" description="The United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station (or NOFS), is an astronomical observatory operated as a Navy Echelon V command and the national dark-sky observing Facility subordinate to the United States Naval Observatory (USNO). USNO (an Echelon IV command) and NOFS are commands within the CNMOC claimancy, the latter which serves the U.S. Navy on meteorological and oceanographic matters in addition to overseeing astronomical ones. The Flagstaff Station is a command which was established at a site five miles west of Flagstaff, Arizona in 1955, and has positions for 35 scientists (astronomers and astrophysicists), optical and mechanical engineers, and support staff. NOFS also operates the Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer in collaboration with Lowell Observatory and the Naval Research Laboratory at Anderson Mesa, 15 miles south east of Flagstaff. The majority of NPOI operations are funded and managed by NOFS leadership in particular. NPOI is one of the few major instruments globally which can conduct optical interferometry. See an illustration of its layout, at bottom. In 2009 efforts began to finalize acceptance of four additional 1.8-meter telescopes into the NPOI array; acceptance occurred in November 2010. NOFS science covers the gamut of astrometric and astrophysical science in order to facilitate its production of very precise astronomical catalogs, such as USNO-B and NOMAD. NOFS scientists are also members of key DARPA, NASA, NRL, MIT, NRAO, Smithsonian, AMOS, and many other academic and DoD science teams, and observe at, major observatories worldwide—both terrestrially and spaceborne. The NOFS staff is organized into five divisions: Optical, Infrared, Engineering &amp;amp; Site Operations, Digital Catalogs, and NPOI Divisions. Additional management staff serve management, IT, fiscal, administrative, and facilities functions. NOFS is the U.S. Navy's highest-elevation facility. Indeed, despite a half-century-young history, NOFS has a rich heritage which is derived from its parent organization, USNO. At an elevation of approximately 7700 feet, NOFS is home to a number of astronomical instruments (some also described in the worldwide list of optical telescopes): The 1.3 m (51-inch) large-field R-C telescope was initially produced by DFM Engineering and then automated by NOFS staff. Corning Glass Works and Kodak made the primary mirror. The telescope sports a state-of-the art, cryogenic wide-field mosaic camera. It will also permit employment of the new &amp;quot;Microcam&amp;quot;, an orthogonal transfer array with Pan-STARRS heritage. The 61-inch Kaj Strand Telescope or 1.55-m Kaj Strand Astrometric Reflector is the largest telescope operated by the Navy since 1964. The Kaj Strand telescope is used in both the visible spectrum, and in the near infrared (NIR), the latter using a helium-cooled InSb (Indium antimonide) camera, &amp;quot;Astrocam&amp;quot;. In 1978, the 1.55-m telescope was used to discover the moon of dwarf planet Pluto, named Charon (Pluto itself was discovered in 1930, across town at Lowell Observatory). The 40-inch telescope, the original Station telescope (moved from USNO in 1955), is still in operation after a half century of astronomy at NOFS, including performing key quasar-based reference frame operations, reference support to orbiting space object information, and performing photometric operations support (along with its newer siblings). The 40-inch also can carry a number of liquid Nitrogen-cooled cameras, including a nine-stellar magnitude neutral density spot array, through which star positions are cross-checked before use in detailed NPOI observations. A modern day example of a fully robotic transit telescope is the small 0.2m (8 in) Flagstaff Astrometric Scanning Transit Telescope (FASTT) located at the observatory. FASTT provides extremely precise positions of solar system objects for incorporation into the USNO Astronomical Almanac and Nautical Almanac. These ephemerides are also used by NASA in the deep space navigation of its planetary and extra-orbital spacecraft. This telescope is responsible for NASA JPL's successful 2005 navigation-to-landing of the Huygens Lander on Titan, a major moon orbiting Saturn. NOFS is the U.S. Navy's National Dark Sky Site, and is responsible for the bulk of the astrometric component of DoD and national Position-Navigation-Time (PNT). The United States Naval Observatory, Flagstaff Station celebrated its 50th anniversary of the move there from Washington, D.C. in late 2005.. Each autumn, NOFS opens its doors annually to the public, during the Flagstaff Festival of Science. In 2009, visitor attendance topped 710. NOFS remains active in supporting regional darks skies, both to support its national protection mission, and to promote and protect a national resource legacy for generations of humans to come. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Naval_Observatory_Flagstaff_Station&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Naval_Observatory_Fla...&lt;/a&gt;" id="5270731787" latitude="35.192994" license="5" longitude="-111.723017" nbComments="0" rank="15" tags="flagstaff arizona coconino" title="Exit of I-40 onto I-40 Business Loop, near Entrance to U.S. Naval Observatory (Flagstaff Station)" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/5081/5270731787_0c63f49dd5_b.jpg" username="Ken Lund" views="232" />

In 1915, he published his Memoir of a Trans-Neptunian Planet, in which he concluded that Planet X had a mass roughly seven times that of the Earth—about half that of Neptune—and a mean distance from the Sun of 43 AU. He assumed Planet X would be a large, low-density object with a high albedo, like the gas giants. Lowell's sudden death in 1916 temporarily halted the search for Planet X. Failing to find the planet, according to one friend, &amp;quot;virtually killed him&amp;quot;. In 1929 the observatory's director, Vesto Melvin Slipher, summarily handed the job of locating the planet to Clyde Tombaugh, a 22-year-old Kansas farm boy who had only just arrived at the Lowell Observatory after Slipher had been impressed by a sample of his astronomical drawings Tombaugh's task was to systematically capture sections of the night sky in pairs of images. Each image in a pair was taken two weeks apart. He then placed both images of each section in a machine called a blink comparator, which by exchanging images quickly created a time lapse illusion of the movement of any planetary body. By the beginning of 1930, Tombaugh's search had reached the constellation of Gemini. On 18 February 1930, after searching for nearly a year and examining nearly 2 million stars, Tombaugh discovered a moving object on photographic plates taken on 23 January and 29 January of that year.

<photo  date_taken="2010-12-17 13:47:53" description="Downtown Flagstaff lies immediately to the east of Mars Hill, the location of Lowell Observatory. Streets in the downtown area are laid out in a grid pattern, parallel to Route 66 and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Rail Line, running east-west through the city. Milton Road branches off from Route 66 west of downtown, and travels south, adjacent to the Northern Arizona University campus, to the junction of Interstate 17 and Interstate 40. Milton continues to the south, becoming State Route 89A, and traveling through Oak Creek Canyon to Sedona. Traveling north from downtown, Fort Valley Road (U.S. 180) connects with the Museum of Northern Arizona, Arizona Snowbowl, and Grand Canyon National Park. Traveling east from downtown, Route 66 and the railroad run in parallel toward East Flagstaff (and beyond), at the base of Mount Elden. Much of Flagstaff's industry is located east of downtown, adjacent to the railroad tracks, as well as in East Flagstaff. Several towns are located close to Flagstaff along Interstates 40 and 17. Approximately 6 miles (9.7 km) south are the small urban areas of Kachina Village (west of I-17) and Mountainaire, Arizona (east of I-17; 2 miles). Both of these areas were built in the early 1960s as second homes for people escaping the Phoenix heat in summer. Recently these areas are now permanent all-year-round housing. About 35 miles (56 km) to the west is Williams, 20 miles (32 km) to the south is Munds Park, which features a semi-public Golf Course called Pinewood, and 30 miles (48 km) to the south on AZ HWY 89a is Sedona. 15 miles (24 km) to the east of Flagstaff is the town of Winona, mentioned in the famous song, Route 66. Holbrook is 90 miles (144 km) to the east. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagstaff,_Arizona&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagstaff,_Arizona&lt;/a&gt;" id="5270733817" latitude="35.198653" license="5" longitude="-111.647475" nbComments="0" rank="96" tags="arizona" title="Downtown Flagstaff, Arizona" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/5088/5270733817_bbb5806137_b.jpg" username="Ken Lund" views="450" />

<photo  date_taken="2010-12-17 13:51:44" description="Flagstaff is a city located in northern Arizona, in the southwestern United States. In 2008, the city's estimated population was 60,222. The population of the Metropolitan Statistical Area was estimated at 127,450 in 2007. It is the county seat of Coconino County. The city is named after a Ponderosa Pine flagpole made by a scouting party from Boston (known as the &amp;quot;Second Boston Party&amp;quot;) to celebrate the United States Centennial on July 4, 1876. Flagstaff lies near the southwestern edge of the Colorado Plateau, along the western side of the largest contiguous Ponderosa Pine forest in the continental United States. Flagstaff is located adjacent to Mount Elden, just south of the San Francisco Peaks, the highest mountain range in the state of Arizona. Humphreys Peak, the highest point in Arizona at 12,633 feet (3,850 m), is located about 10 miles (16 km) north of Flagstaff in Kachina Peaks Wilderness. Flagstaff's early economy was based on the lumber, railroad, and ranching industries. Today, the city remains an important distribution hub for companies such as Nestlé Purina PetCare and Walgreens, and is home to Lowell Observatory, The U.S. Naval Observatory, the United States Geological Survey Flagstaff Station and Northern Arizona University. Flagstaff has a strong tourism sector, due to its proximity to Grand Canyon National Park, Oak Creek Canyon, the Arizona Snowbowl, Meteor Crater and historic Route 66. The city is also home to medical device manufacturing, including such companies as W. L.
