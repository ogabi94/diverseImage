<photo  date_taken="2009-01-23 17:14:56" description="The Wies. Pilgrimage Church of the &amp;quot;Scourged Saviour&amp;quot;. The large ceiling fresco. This fresco represents a brilliant highpoint of the joyous rococo style whereby the art of fresco painting and the art of stucco are combined with absolute perfection. The Resurrected Christ is the focal point of the painting. He is enthroned on the rainbow, a symbol of forgiveness and of the covenant with mankind reaching from the days of Noach up to the days when Christ will return to earth in all his glory. Jesus points to the cross as the sign of his love until death. He is accompanied by angels (among them Mary with halo and wings) and the twelve apostles to the left and right. The trompets of the Last Judgement, sounded by angels, announce that the trone of justice is prepared. Christ has not yet taken his place on his seat of justice, rather he rules from the rainbow and points to his wounded heart: love is the focal point of all existence and is the real seat of judgement, where God in his mercy and divine justice will pass judgement on each individual person as well as on all of humanity. more: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wies_Church&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wies_Church&lt;/a&gt; De Bedevaartskerk van Wies (Duits: Wieskirche) is een ovale rococokerk, gelegen in de plaats Wies, gemeente Steingaden (Beieren) aan de voet van de Alpen in Duitsland. Ze werd gebouwd in de late jaren 1740. In 1738 werden tranen gezien op een oud houten beeld van de Gegeselde Verlosser. Dit mirakel leidde tot een toevloed van bedevaarders. In 1740 werd een kleine kapel gebouwd om het beeld te huisvesten, maar al snel bleek dat het gebouw te klein was in verhouding met het aantal pelgrims dat het aantrok. Daarop besliste de abdij van Steingaden om er een afzonderlijke kerk aan te wijden. uit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedevaartskerk_van_Wies&quot;&gt;nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedevaartskerk_van_Wies&lt;/a&gt;" id="3251956369" latitude="0" license="2" longitude="0" nbComments="0" rank="1" tags="thewies bavaria germany pilgrimagechurch beieren pelgrims rococo duitsland" title="The Wies - Bavaria - Germany" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/3424/3251956369_db49d7aae9_b.jpg" username="Rita Willaert" views="753" />
