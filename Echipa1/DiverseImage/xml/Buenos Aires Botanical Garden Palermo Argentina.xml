<photo  date_taken="1999-05-20 00:00:07" description="From Wikipedia - The Buenos Aires Botanical Garden (whose official name in Spanish is Jardín Botánico Carlos Thays de la Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires) is located in the Palermo neighbourhood of Buenos Aires in Argentina. The garden is triangular in shape, and is bounded by Sante Fé Avenue, Las Heras Avenue and República Árabe Siria Street. Palermo Park, the Buenos Aires Zoo and the Japanese Garden are all nearby. The garden, which was declared a national monument in 1996, has a total area of 69,772 m2, and holds around 5,500 species of plants, trees and shrubs, as well as a number of sculptures, monuments and 5 winter-houses. Designed by French-born Argentine architect and landscape designer Carlos Thays, the garden was inaugurated on September 7, 1898. Thays and his family lived in an English style mansion, located within the gardens, between 1892 and 1898, when he served as director of parks and walks in the city. The mansion, built in 1881, is currently the main building of the complex. In recent years a large community of cats has established itself within the garden, encouraged by neighbours who leave food out for them. Attempts to remove the cats have so far proved unsuccessful but thanks to the dedication of volunteers in the local community who formed a voluntary committee, a humane resolution became possible, cats are allowed to live out their lives and no new cats are allowed in the garden while the current population receives care and free veterinary services from Instituto de Zoonosis Luis Pasteur. Collections The park has three distinct landscape gardening styles; the symmetric, the mixed and the picturesque, recreated in the Roman, French and Oriental gardens. ROMAN GARDEN This holds species of tree that the first century Roman botanist Pliny the Younger had in his villa in the Apennine mountains, such as cypresses, poplars, and laurels. FRENCH GARDEN This has a symmetric French style of the 17th and 18th century. ORIENTAL GARDEN In other areas the plants are ordered by origin; from Asia can be seen Ginkgo biloba; from Oceania Acacias, Eucalyptus and Casuarinas; from Europe oaks, hazelnut trees and olmos; from Africa brackens, palms, and gomeros. There are also other plantae from the Americas, such as sequoias from United States and Chorisia speciosa (Palo Borracho), also called Floss silk tree from Brazil and Argentina. An abundant collection of flora from Argentina and the Southern Cone is present. In other sections plant species are systematically ordered by theretaxonomic qualification. Within the garden is the Municipal Gardening School Cristóbal María Hicken, which is linked to the Faculty of Agronomy of the University of Buenos Aires. The garden also contains 33 artistic works including sculptures, busts and monuments. Among these are Los primeros Fríos by the Catalan sculptor Blay y Fábregas, Sagunto by Querol y Subirats, Figura de mujer by Lola Mora, and Saturnalia made in bronze by Ernesto Biondi. Other attractions include the five winter-houses, the biggest of which is in Art Nouveau style and received recognition in the Paris Universal Exhibition in 1889. It has a length of 35 meters, a width of 8, contains 2500 tropical plants and is considered to be the only winter-house in that style still conserved in the world. There is also a monument entitled Indicador Meteorológico (Weather Indicator), designed by José Markovich, and presented by the Austro-Hungarian Empire community for the Exposición Internacional del Centenario (1910). The Botanic Library has 1,000 books and 10,000 publications from all parts of the world, which are freely available to visitors. The park also contains a Botanical Museum.

<photo  date_taken="1999-05-20 00:00:01" description="Buenos Aires Botanical Garden - May 1999. From Wikipedia - The Floss Silk Tree (Ceiba speciosa, formerly Chorisia speciosa), is a species of deciduous tree native to the tropical and subtropical forests of South America. It has many local common names, such as Palo Borracho (in Spanish literally &amp;quot;drunken tree&amp;quot;). It belongs to the same family as the baobab and the kapok - the Malvaceae. Another tree of the Ceiba genus, C. chodatii, often receives the same common names. The natural habitat of the Floss Silk Tree is the north-east of Argentina, Paraguay, and southern Brazil. It is resistant to drought and moderate cold. It grows fast in spurts when water is abundant, and sometimes reaches more than 25 m in height. Its trunk is bottle-shaped, generally bulging in its lower third, measuring up to 2 m in girth. It is studded with thick conical prickles which serve to store water for dry times. In younger trees, the trunk is green due to its high chlorophyll content, which makes it capable of performing photosynthesis when leaves are absent; with age it turns to gray. The branches tend to be horizontal and are also covered with prickles. The leaves are composed of five to seven long leaflets. The flowers are creamy-whitish in the center and pink towards the tips of their five petals. They measure 10-15 cm in diameter and their shape is not unlike Hibiscus flowers. Their nectar is known to attract insects such as monarch butterflies, which perform pollination. Ceiba speciosa flowers are in bloom between February and May. The flowers of the related C. chodatii are similar in form and size, but their color goes from creamy white centers to yellow tips. The fruits are lignous ovoid pods, 20 cm long, which contain bean-sized black seeds surrounded by a mass of fibrous, fluffy matter reminiscent of cotton or silk. The cotton inside the fruit pods, although not of as good quality as kapok, has been used as stuffing for pillows and thermic insulation at times. The wood of this tree is light, soft and flexible, and is employed in packaging, to make canoes, as wood pulp to make paper, and in ropes. From the seeds it is possible to obtain vegetable oil (both edible and industrially useful). The Floss Silk Tree is cultivated mostly for ornamental purposes. Outside of private gardens around the world, it is often planted along urban streets. Ceiba speciosa is added to some versions of the hallucinogenic drink Ayahuasca." id="3404696377" latitude="-34.58245" license="5" longitude="-58.417546" nbComments="0" rank="16" tags="argentina buenosaires palermo botanicalgarden jardinbotanic carlosthays malvaceae ceibaspeciosa chorisiaspeciosa flosssilktree paloborracho flower flowers" title="Chorisia speciosa (Ceiba speciosa)" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/3657/3404696377_ac0eea1510_b.jpg" username="wallygrom" views="208" />
