<photo  date_taken="2008-01-09 14:19:34" description="Portland Observatory (and Bug Light) taken from Spring Point. It's not a lighthouse - and it has nothing to do with astronomy! The Portland Observatory (1807) is the only extant maritime signal station in the United States, and thus a unique architectural icon of maritime shipping and the &amp;quot;Golden Age of Sail.&amp;quot; The Portland Observatory was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, and became a National Historic Landmark in 2006. Sea captain-turned-entrepreneur, Lemuel Moody (1768-1846), ordered construction of this octagonal, 86 feet-high tower to serve as a communication station for Portland's bustling harbor. With his powerful telescope, Moody identified incoming vessels and then signaled merchants with coded signal flags. &amp;quot;Signalizing&amp;quot; allowed merchants ample time to reserve a berth on the wharves, and to hire a crew of stevedores before a vessel docked. The Observatory was built at the eastern end of the Portland peninsula on Munjoy Hill, which was a cow pasture at the time. Moody built his home and other buildings near the tower. The complex was replete with banquet and dance halls as well as a bowling alley. From the time it opened in 1807, it was a tourist attraction.

<photo  date_taken="2009-08-16 16:02:05" description="Waldo-Hancock bridge (left) Technologically, the Waldo-Hancock Bridge represents a number of firsts. It was one of the first two bridges in the U.S. (along with the St. Johns Bridge in Portland, Oregon, completed in June, 1931) to employ Robinson and Steinman’s prestressed twisted wire strand cables, which were first used on the 1929 Grand Mère Suspension Bridge over the Saint-Maurice River in Quebec. The prefabrication and prestressing of the cables, along with other innovations, invented and pioneered by Steinman, were a significant step forward for builders of suspension bridges. The Waldo-Hancock was also the first bridge to make use of the Vierendeel truss in its two towers, giving it an effect that Steinman called “artistic, emphasizing horizontal and vertical lines.” This attractive and effective truss design was later used in a number of important bridges, including the Triborough Bridge and Golden Gate Bridge. The Waldo-Hancock Bridge was noted at the time for its economy of design and construction. It cost far less than had been appropriated by the State Highway Commission, which enabled the construction of a second bridge between Verona Island and Bucksport. source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldo-Hancock_Bridge&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldo-Hancock_Bridge&lt;/a&gt; The Penobscot Narrows Bridge and Observatory (right); The Penobscot Narrows Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge over the Penobscot River near Bucksport, Maine. It replaces the Waldo-Hancock Bridge, built in 1931. The new bridge is 2,120 feet (646 m) long. It is one of two bridges in the U.S. constructed recently to utilize a cradle system that carries the strands within the stays from bridge deck to bridge deck, as a continuous element, eliminating anchorages in the pylons. Each epoxy-coated steel strand is carried inside the cradle in a one-inch steel tube. Each strand acts independently, allowing for removal, inspection and replacement of individual strands. The cable-stay system was designed with a system that uses pressurized nitrogen gas to defend against corrosion. Additionally, in June 2007, six reference strands within three stays were replaced with carbon fiber strands - a first in the U.S. Monitoring on the strands will evaluate this material for future use in bridge designs. These engineering innovations helped the bridge appear in the December 2006 edition of Popular Science as one of the 100 best innovations of the year. The total project cost was $85 million. The bridge was designed as an emergency replacement for the Waldo-Hancock Bridge and from conception to completion, just 42 months elapsed. Observation Tower: The Penobscot Bridge site also is home to the Penobscot Narrows Observatory, the first bridge observation tower in the United States and the tallest public bridge observatory in the world. The tower reaches 420 feet (128 m) into the air and allows visitors to view the bridge, the nearby Fort Knox State Historic Site and the Penobscot River and Bay. The tower is accessible through the Fort Knox site and as of August 2009 charges a $7 fee for adults which includes admission to both the Observatory and the Fort Knox site. source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penobscot_Narrows_Bridge&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penobscot_Narrows_Bridge&lt;/a&gt; The new replaces the old and the new becomes the old and so it goes................" id="3863770304" latitude="0" license="4" longitude="0" nbComments="9" rank="24" tags="maine us usa bridge new old replacement waldohancock penobscot river penobscotnarrows bucksport" title="A Tale of Two Bridges" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/2566/3863770304_801fb0768d_b.jpg" username="Tony Fischer Photography" views="406" />
<photo  date_taken="2007-08-25 10:17:33" description="11,249 foot Mount Hood, one of the most spectacular mountains in the northwestern U.S. Mount Hood, called Wy'east by the Multnomah tribe, is a stratovolcano in the Cascade Volcanic Arc of northern Oregon. It was formed by a subduction zone and rests in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is located about 50 miles (80 km) east-southeast of Portland, on the border between Clackamas and Hood River counties. Mount Hood's snow-covered peak rises 11,249 feet (3,429 m) and is home to twelve glaciers. (Older surveys said 11,239 feet (3,426 m), which is still often cited as its height). It is the highest mountain in Oregon and the fourth-highest in the Cascade Range. Mount Hood is considered the Oregon volcano most likely to erupt, though based on its history, an explosive eruption is unlikely. Still, the odds of an eruption in the next 30 years are estimated at between 3 and 7 percent, so the USGS characterizes it as &amp;quot;potentially active&amp;quot;, but the mountain is informally considered dormant. Timberline Lodge is a National Historic Landmark located on the southern flank of Mount Hood just below Palmer Glacier. The mountain has six ski areas: Timberline, Mount Hood Meadows, Ski Bowl, Cooper Spur, Snow Bunny and Summit. They total over 4,600 acres (7.2 sq mi; 18.6 km2) of skiable terrain; Timberline offers the only year-round lift-served skiing in North America. Mount Hood is part of the Mount Hood National Forest, which has 1.067 million acres (1667 sq mi/4318 km²), four designated wilderness areas which total 189,200 acres (295.6 sq mi; 766 km2) acres and more than 1,200 miles (1,900 km) of hiking trails. The glacially eroded summit area consists of several andesitic or dacitic lava domes; Pleistocene collapses produced avalanches and lahars (rapidly moving mudflows) that traveled across the Columbia River to the north. The eroded volcano has had at least four major eruptive periods during the past 15,000 years. The last three at Mount Hood occurred within the past 1,800 years from vents high on the southwest flank and produced deposits that were distributed primarily to the south and west along the Sandy and Zigzag Rivers. The last eruptive period took place around 170 to 220 years ago, when dacitic lava domes, pyroclastic flows and mudflows were produced without major explosive eruptions. The prominent Crater Rock just below the summit is hypothesized to be the remains of one of these now-eroded domes. This period includes the last major eruption of 1781–82 with a slightly more recent episode ending shortly before the arrival of Lewis and Clark in 1805. The latest minor eruptive event occurred in August 1907. The glaciers on the mountain's upper slopes may be a source of potentially dangerous lahars when the mountain next erupts. There are vents near the summit that are known for emitting noxious gases such as carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Prior to the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, the only known fatality related to volcanic activity in the Cascades occurred in 1934 when a climber suffocated in oxygen-poor air while exploring ice caves melted by fumaroles in Coalman Glacier. Since 1950, there have been several earthquake swarms each year at Mount Hood, most notably in July 1980 and June 2002. Seismic activity is monitored by the USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory located in Vancouver, Washington, which issues daily updates. The most recent evidence of volcanic activity at Mount Hood consists of fumaroles near Crater Rock and hot springs on the flanks of the volcano. Since first seen by European explorers in 1792, Mount Hood is believed to have maintained a consistent summit elevation, varying by no more than a few feet due to mild seismic activity. Elevation changes since the 1950s are predominantly due to improved survey methods and model refinements of the shape of the Earth (see vertical reference datum). Despite the physical consistency, the estimated elevation of Mount Hood has varied substantially over the years. Early explorers on the Columbia River estimated the elevation to be 10,000 to 12,000 feet (3,000 to 3,700 m). Two persons in Thomas J. Dryer's 1854 expedition calculated the elevation to be 18,361 feet (5,596 m) and that the tree line was at about 11,250 feet (3,430 m). Two months later, a Mr. Belden claimed to have climbed the mountain during a hunting trip and determined it to be 19,400 feet (5,900 m) upon which &amp;quot;pores oozed blood, eyes bled, and blood rushed from their ears.&amp;quot; Sometime by 1866, Reverend G. H. Atkinson determined it to be 17,600 feet (5,400 m). A Portland engineer used surveying methods from a Portland baseline and calculated a height of between 18,000 and 19,000 feet (5,500 and 5,800 m). Many maps distributed in the late 1800s cited 18,361 feet (5,596 m), though Mitchell's School Atlas gave 14,000 feet (4,300 m) as the correct value. For some time, many references assumed Mount Hood to be the highest point in North America. Mount Hood's treeline varies from about 5,500 feet (1,700 m), mostly on the western faces, to about 7,000 feet (2,100 m), mostly on the eastern side. Mount Hood is host to twelve named glaciers or snow fields, the most visited of which is Palmer Glacier, partially within the Timberline Lodge ski area and on the most popular climbing route. The glaciers are almost exclusively above the 6,000-foot (1,800 m) level, which also is about the average tree line elevation on Mount Hood. More than 80% of the glacial surface area is above 7,000 feet (2,100 m). The glacial surface area totals about 145 million square feet (5.2 square miles) and contains a volume of about 12.3 billion cubic feet (0.084 cubic miles). Eliot Glacier is the largest by volume at 3.2 billion cubic feet (91,000,000 m3), and has the thickest depth measured by ice radar at 361 feet (110 m). The largest surface area is the Coe-Ladd Glacier system at 23,100,000 square feet (2,150,000 m2). Glaciers and snowfields cover about 80 percent of the mountain above the 6,900-foot (2,100 m) level. The glaciers have lost an average of 34% over the twentieth century (1907-2004). Glaciers on Mount Hood retreated through the first half of the 1900s, advanced or at least slowed their retreat in the 1960s and 1970s, and have since returned to a pattern of retreat. The neo-glacial maximum extents formed in the early 1700s. During the last major glacial event between 10,000 and 29,000 years ago, glaciers reached down to the 2,300-foot (700 m) to 2,600-foot (790 m) level: a distance of 9.3 miles (15.0 km) from the summit. The retreat released considerable outwash, some of which filled and flattened the upper Hood River Valley near Parkdale and also formed Dee Flat. Older glaciation produced moraines near Brightwood and distinctive cuts on the southeast side; they may date to 140,000 years ago. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Hood&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Hood&lt;/a&gt;" id="1291995980" latitude="45.376267" license="5" longitude="-121.69384" nbComments="0" rank="25" tags="hoodriver mounthood hood mthood oregon columbiariver" title="Mount Hood (4)" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/1376/1291995980_2b9103cdda_b.jpg" username="Ken Lund" views="225" />

<photo  date_taken="2012-03-27 11:23:32" description="Billions of people will see London through many different filters and lenses during the 2012 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games. None of those views will look quite like this one from the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite. The image above shows London and the southern half of Great Britain as it appeared on the night of March 27, 2012. While most of the events in the 2012 Olympics will be held in the greater London area, several other cities and towns will host events, including: canoeing at Lee Valley White Water Center; sailing in Weymouth and Portland; rowing and canoeing at Eton Dorney; and cycling and mountain bike events at Hadleigh Farm. The image was acquired by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on Suomi NPP, which includes a “day-night band” similar to images collected by the Operational Linescan System (OLS) flown on U.S. Defense Meterological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites. The day-night band observes light in a range of wavelengths from green to near-infrared, and uses light intensification to enable the detection of dim signals, according to Chris Elvidge, who leads the Earth Observation Group at NOAA’s National Geophysical Data Center and works on the VIIRS team. “In wavelength-speak, the range for visible light is about 400 (blue light) to 700 (red light) nanometers, and the day/night band’s sensitivity is 500 to 900 nanometers,” said Steve Miller, a researcher in the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere at Colorado State University. “There are a lot of satellites up there with sensitivity to this same range, but the special thing about the day/night band is its high sensitivity to very low amounts of this light. It can sense light 100,000 times fainter than the conventional visible light sensors. That makes it very sensitive to things like moonlight, city lights, among many other things.” The night views of Earth are more than just a novelty. “Nightime lights are the least ambiguous remote sensing observation indicating the presence and magnitude of human activities and the density of development,” said Elvidge. Seeing Earth’s night lighting has practical applications in studying human populations, economic activity, habitat fragmentation and encroachment, and energy use. “We can actually look at cities and tell you how much energy is emanating from them,” Miller added, “something pretty useful for energy consumption studies.” Other scientists use the nighttime views to choose sites for astronomical observatories, study the impact of nocturnal lighting, and to monitor power outages and natural disasters. In meteorology, the combination of VIIRS nighttime views and thermal imaging is valuable for things like differentiating high clouds from low clouds from fog banks. Suomi NPP was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base on October 28, 2011, and is the result of a partnership between NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Department of Defense.

Lancaster's proposal to construct a building on the summit of Crown Point was another reflection of his desire to inspire the traveller along the highway and to make the wonders of the gorge accessible. As Lancaster described it, the Crown Point promontory was the ideal site for &amp;quot;an observatory from which the view both up and down the Columbia could be viewed in silent communion with the infinite&amp;quot;. Such an observatory would also be a fitting memorial to &amp;quot;the trials and hardships of those who had come into the Oregon country.&amp;quot; And it could &amp;quot;serve as a comfort station for the tourist and the travellers of America's greatest highway.&amp;quot; He suggested it be known as the Vista House. The official opening of the Columbia River Highway from Portland to Hood River marked the completion of a tremendous feat in highway construction. On May 5, 1918, dedication of the highway took place at Crown Point. On that rocky promontory, 733 feet above the Columbia River, construction of Vista House began that same year. The construction of Vista House was completed by Multnomah County, under the direction of John B. Yeon, Multnomah County roadmaster. Plans for the interior decorations were furnished by Samuel Lancaster. Total cost of the Vista House construction was approximately $100,000.00. There has been some kind of commercial activity in the Vista House since its inception. Cross &amp;amp; Dimmitt produced and sold post cards in the building for many of it's early years. There was a gift shop in operation by a succession of concessionaires for many years. The nature of the operation of the building changed when, in 1982, the Friends of Vista House formed and worked in cooperation with Oregon Parks and Recreation Department to provide more education to the public and operate the building in a more interpretive manner. The friends operate a gallery in the lower level to raise funds for the interpretive and restoration projects." id="259337210" latitude="0" license="3" longitude="0" nbComments="12" rank="29" tags="raw vistahouse womansforum crownpoint statepark corbett oregon or 970199725" title="Vista House" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/122/259337210_322d27a0a2_b.jpg" username="StarrGazr" views="523" />

None of those views will look quite like this one from the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite. The image above shows London and the southern half of Great Britain as it appeared on the night of March 27, 2012. While most of the events in the 2012 Olympics will be held in the greater London area, several other cities and towns will host events, including: canoeing at Lee Valley White Water Center; sailing in Weymouth and Portland; rowing and canoeing at Eton Dorney; and cycling and mountain bike events at Hadleigh Farm. The image was acquired by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on Suomi NPP, which includes a “day-night band” similar to images collected by the Operational Linescan System (OLS) flown on U.S. Defense Meterological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites. The day-night band observes light in a range of wavelengths from green to near-infrared, and uses light intensification to enable the detection of dim signals, according to Chris Elvidge, who leads the Earth Observation Group at NOAA’s National Geophysical Data Center and works on the VIIRS team. “In wavelength-speak, the range for visible light is about 400 (blue light) to 700 (red light) nanometers, and the day/night band’s sensitivity is 500 to 900 nanometers,” said Steve Miller, a researcher in the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere at Colorado State University. “There are a lot of satellites up there with sensitivity to this same range, but the special thing about the day/night band is its high sensitivity to very low amounts of this light. It can sense light 100,000 times fainter than the conventional visible light sensors. That makes it very sensitive to things like moonlight, city lights, among many other things.” The night views of Earth are more than just a novelty. “Nightime lights are the least ambiguous remote sensing observation indicating the presence and magnitude of human activities and the density of development,” said Elvidge. Seeing Earth’s night lighting has practical applications in studying human populations, economic activity, habitat fragmentation and encroachment, and energy use. “We can actually look at cities and tell you how much energy is emanating from them,” Miller added, “something pretty useful for energy consumption studies.” Other scientists use the nighttime views to choose sites for astronomical observatories, study the impact of nocturnal lighting, and to monitor power outages and natural disasters. In meteorology, the combination of VIIRS nighttime views and thermal imaging is valuable for things like differentiating high clouds from low clouds from fog banks. Suomi NPP was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base on October 28, 2011, and is the result of a partnership between NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Department of Defense.

On January 20, more than 250,000 customers were without electricity, as utility crews struggled to restore power, news sources said. Rising temperatures and potential new rainfall raised the possibility of flooding in the days that followed. Snow still blanketed much of Washington state on January 23, 2012, when the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Terra satellite captured these images. Snow blankets the region east of Seattle and Portland, stretching all the way to the Idaho border. In the band of forest along the Pacific Coast, snow may be more prevalent than it appears, as it is sometimes hidden from satellite imagers by trees. Warmer air blew into the region soon after the storm, adding to hazardous conditions. Flooding closed roads and forced some residents into emergency shelters. On January 23, KVAL reported that a fresh storm was approaching the region and might drop several inches of rain. The National Weather Service issued a flood warning for the Portland area, as the new round of rain had the potential to push rivers into flood stage.

<photo  date_taken="2009-02-05 14:27:36" description="Pic: Chinese Gardens in Portland, Oregon, all the stones and wood were brought in from China (we went there on Thursday with Cryn and her friend) It is a beautiful place that I would love to visit in the spring or summer when everything is blooming. Ok soooooooooooooo I got a job interview!!! I have the interview on the 11th... so 2 more days! I've been extremely happy, the first day i found out I thought i was walking on clouds! The interview is with the Rocky Mountain Bird Observatory in Colorado as an Education Assistant! So please cross your fingers from me on Wednesday! :) We have had quite a week. We went to the chinese gardens on thursday and snowshoeing in mt. hood national forest on Saturday! Once I adjust the lighting of the moutain pictures I will post them up. It's really pretty up there. Oh and I did my taxes last week! I HATE DOING TAXES! I mean I never have to pay any because I always pay to much towards taxes but just the process of going thru all the boxes and information (i do mine on the internet) is super annoying! Wahoo for a little chunk of money! :) So our time in Portland is winding down and we have been hanging out alot more with our amigos before we take off. I'm kind of counting down the days to be out of our apartment, but I will definately miss the friends I made especially Jess and Elaine! :)" id="3267081953" latitude="0" license="4" longitude="0" nbComments="0" rank="142" tags="" title="Week 11: Feb. 2-8 Exciting News!" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/1410/3267081953_e0dee51d62_b.jpg" username="Sipris Swan" views="56" />
