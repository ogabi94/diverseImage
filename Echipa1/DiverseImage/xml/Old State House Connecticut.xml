Written by John W. Barry Gannett News Service FILED UNDER News Local News &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.floridatoday.com/viewart/20130103/NEWS01/301030037/Paper-s-gun-list-request-fires-up-many&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.floridatoday.com/viewart/20130103/NEWS01/301030037/Pa...&lt;/a&gt; CARMEL, N.Y. — Putnam County officials, who say they will refuse a newspaper’s request to release the names and addresses of residents with pistol permits, would break New York law in withholding the data, a state official said. The opinion from Robert Freeman, executive director of the state’s Committee on Open Government, came after an announcement Tuesday from a state senator and two county officials that they would refuse to release the data requested by The (Westchester, N.Y.) Journal News, which sought the records under the state Freedom of Information Law. Putnam County officials in December said it was compiling the data. Putnam County has about 100,000 residents and is part of the New York metropolitan area. State Sen. Greg Ball, a Republican from Patterson, N.Y., called The Journal News' decision to publish the data “asinine” and an invasion of privacy. He scheduled a news conference today with Putnam County Executive MaryEllen Odell and Putnam County Clerk Dennis Sant to announce the decision. Sant said his office has received an onslaught of calls demanding that he not release the data. But Freeman said the law is clear: “The name and address of any gun licensee are public.” On Dec. 23, The Journal News published a report and interactive map, identifying the names and addresses of those who legally hold pistol permits in Westchester and Rockland counties. At that time, a request also was made to Putnam County. That map ignited a firestorm of controversy but also generated support. All three requests for the gun data followed last month’s mass killing at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. Freeman said The Journal News could appeal a denial, which would be heard within Putnam County government. If a second denial occurred, the paper could ask a judge to decide. The Wall Street Journal asked New York City officials to turn over similar gun data several years ago. Freeman said that request was denied, but the state’s highest court later ruled in favor of the newspaper. Page 1 of 2 . ................................. . Page 2 of 2 Page 2 of 2) Ball was firm in his position. “I’m proud to stand with Putnam County and proud that Putnam won’t be releasing its pistol permit records,” he said in a statement. “The asinine editors at The Journal News have gone out of their way to place a virtual scarlet letter on law-abiding firearm owners throughout the region and I thank God that Putnam County has a clerk with the guts to stand up and draw the line here.” Sant said he was happy to protect law-abiding gun owners in his county. “There is the rule of law, and there is right and wrong, and The Journal News is clearly wrong,” he said in a statement. “I could not live with myself if one Putnam pistol permit holder was put in harm’s way, for the sole purpose of selling newspapers.” Odell could not be reached for comment. Journal News President and Publisher Janet Hasson defended her publication Tuesday. “We believe the law is clear that this is public information, and the residents of Putnam County are entitled to see it,” she said. “We’re troubled that county officials have apparently switched their position since we first requested the information.” . . ............................................................................................................................................................................................. . ." id="8341134865" latitude="0" license="1" longitude="0" nbComments="0" rank="10" tags="thehouseofthearrow1953 doorwaytodanger oscarhomolkayvonnefurneauxroberturquhart notsuitableforchildren floridatoday papersgunlistrequestfiresupmany putnamcountysofficialssayharmmaybeendresult 1231amjan32013| writtenbyjohnwbarrygannettnewsservice firearmsaleshavesurgedrecentlyasspeculationofstrictergunlaws andareinstatementoftheassaultweaponsban followingthemassschoolshootinginconnecticutgettyimages ondec23thejournalnewswestchesternypublishedareport andinteractivemapidentifyingthenamesandaddresses ofthosewholegallyholdpistolpermitsinwestchesterandrocklandcounties atthattimearequestalsowasmadetoputnamcounty i’mstatesengregballarepublicanfrompattersonnyproudtostandwithputnamcounty andproudthatputnamwon’tbereleasingitspistolpermitrecordshesaidinastatement theasinineeditorsatthejournalnewshavegoneoutoftheirway toplaceavirtualscarletletteronlawabidingfirearmowners throughouttheregionandithankgodthatputnamcountyhasaclerk withthegutstostandupanddrawthelinehere thereistheruleoflawandthereisrightandwrong andthejournalnewsisclearlywronghesaidinastatement santputnamcountyclerkdennissantsaidhewashappytoprotectlawabidinggunownersinhiscounty icouldnotlivewithmyselfifoneputnampistolpermitholderwasputinharm’sway forthesolepurposeofsellingnewspapers journalnewspresidentandpublisherjanethassondefendedherpublicationtuesday webelievethelawisclearthatthisispublicinformation andtheresidentsofputnamcountyareentitledtoseeitshesaid we’retroubledthatcountyofficialshaveapparentlyswitchedtheirposition sincewefirstrequestedtheinformation carmelny—putnamcountyofficialswhosaytheywillrefuseanewspaper’srequest toreleasethenamesandaddressesofresidentswithpistolpermits wouldbreaknewyorklawinwithholdingthedataastateofficialsaid" title="The House of the Arrow (1953) ...

U. S. Army pilots flew the P-38 over Europe, the Mediterranean, and the Pacific; from the frozen Aleutian Islands to the sun-baked deserts of North Africa. Measured by success in combat, Lockheed engineer Clarence &amp;quot;Kelly&amp;quot; Johnson and a team of designers created the most successful twin-engine fighter ever flown by any nation. In the Pacific Theater, Lightning pilots downed more Japanese aircraft than pilots flying any other Army Air Forces warplane. Johnson and his team conceived this twin-engine, single-pilot fighter airplane in 1936 and the Army Air Corps authorized the firm to build it in June 1937. Lockheed finished constructing the prototype XP-38 and delivered it to the Air Corps on New Year's Day, 1939. Air Corps test pilot and P-38 project officer, Lt. Benjamin S. Kelsey, first flew the aircraft on January 27. Losing this prototype in a crash at Mitchel Field, New York, with Kelsey at the controls, did not deter the Air Corps from ordering 13 YP-38s for service testing on April 27. Kelsey survived the crash and remained an important part of the Lightning program. Before the airplane could be declared ready for combat, Lockheed had to block the effects of high-speed aerodynamic compressibility and tail buffeting, and solve other problems discovered during the service tests. The most vexing difficulty was the loss of control in a dive caused by aerodynamic compressibility. During late spring 1941, Air Corps Major Signa A. Gilke encountered serious trouble while diving his Lightning at high-speed from an altitude of 9,120 m (30,000 ft). When he reached an indicated airspeed of about 515 kph (320 mph), the airplane's tail began to shake violently and the nose dropped until the dive was almost vertical. Signa recovered and landed safely and the tail buffet problem was soon resolved after Lockheed installed new fillets to improve airflow where the cockpit gondola joined the wing center section. Seventeen months passed before engineers began to determine what caused the Lightning's nose to drop. They tested a scale model P-38 in the Ames Laboratory wind tunnel operated by the NACA (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics) and found that shock waves formed when airflow over the wing leading edges reached transonic speeds. The nose drop and loss of control was never fully remedied but Lockheed installed dive recovery flaps under each wing in 1944. These devices slowed the P-38 enough to allow the pilot to maintain control when diving at high-speed. Just as the development of the North American P-51 Mustang, Republic P-47 Thunderbolt, and the Vought F4U Corsair (see NASM collection for these aircraft) pushed the limits of aircraft performance into unexplored territory, so too did P-38 development. The type of aircraft envisioned by the Lockheed design team and Air Corps strategists in 1937 did not appear until June 1944. This protracted shakedown period mirrors the tribulations suffered by Vought in sorting out the many technical problems that kept F4U Corsairs off U. S. Navy carrier decks until the end of 1944. Lockheed's efforts to trouble-shoot various problems with the design also delayed high-rate, mass production. When Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, the company had delivered only 69 Lightnings to the Army. Production steadily increased and at its peak in 1944, 22 sub-contractors built various Lightning components and shipped them to Burbank, California, for final assembly. Consolidated-Vultee (Convair) subcontracted to build the wing center section and the firm later became prime manufacturer for 2,000 P-38Ls but that company's Nashville plant completed only 113 examples of this Lightning model before war's end. Lockheed and Convair finished 10,038 P-38 aircraft including 500 photo-reconnaissance models. They built more L models, 3,923, than any other version. To ease control and improve stability, particularly at low speeds, Lockheed equipped all Lightnings, except a batch ordered by Britain, with propellers that counter-rotated. The propeller to the pilot's left turned counter-clockwise and the propeller to his right turned clockwise, so that one propeller countered the torque and airflow effects generated by the other. The airplane also performed well at high speeds and the definitive P-38L model could make better than 676 kph (420 mph) between 7,600 and 9,120 m (25,000 and 30,000 ft). The design was versatile enough to carry various combinations of bombs, air-to-ground rockets, and external fuel tanks. The multi-engine configuration reduced the Lightning loss-rate to anti-aircraft gunfire during ground attack missions. Single-engine airplanes equipped with power plants cooled by pressurized liquid, such as the North American P-51 Mustang (see NASM collection), were particularly vulnerable. Even a small nick in one coolant line could cause the engine to seize in a matter of minutes. The first P-38s to reach the Pacific combat theater arrived on April 4, 1942, when a version of the Lightning that carried reconnaissance cameras (designated the F-4), joined the 8th Photographic Squadron based in Australia. This unit launched the first P-38 combat missions over New Guinea and New Britain during April. By May 29, the first 25 P-38s had arrived in Anchorage, Alaska. On August 9, pilots of the 343rd Fighter Group, Eleventh Air Force, flying the P-38E, shot down a pair of Japanese flying boats. Back in the United States, Army Air Forces leaders tried to control a rumor that Lightnings killed their own pilots. On August 10, 1942, Col. Arthur I. Ennis, Chief of U. S. Army Air Forces Public Relations in Washington, told a fellow officer &amp;quot;… Here's what the 4th Fighter [training] Command is up against… common rumor out there that the whole West Coast was filled with headless bodies of men who jumped out of P-38s and had their heads cut off by the propellers.&amp;quot; Novice Lightning pilots unfamiliar with the correct bailout procedures actually had more to fear from the twin-boom tail, if an emergency dictated taking to the parachute but properly executed, Lightning bailouts were as safe as parachuting from any other high-performance fighter of the day. Misinformation and wild speculation about many new aircraft was rampant during the early War period. Along with U. S. Navy Grumman F4F Wildcats (see NASM collection) and Curtiss P-40 Warhawks (see NASM collection), Lightnings were the first American fighter airplanes capable of consistently defeating Japanese fighter aircraft. On November 18, men of the 339th Fighter Squadron became the first Lightning pilots to attack Japanese fighters. Flying from Henderson Field on Guadalcanal, they claimed three during a mission to escort Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers (see NASM collection). On April 18, 1943, fourteen P-38 pilots from the 70th and the 339th Fighter Squadrons, 347th Fighter Group, accomplished one of the most important Lightning missions of the war. American ULTRA cryptanalysts had decoded Japanese messages that revealed the timetable for a visit to the front by the commander of the Imperial Japanese Navy, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto. This charismatic leader had crafted the plan to attack Pearl Harbor and Allied strategists believed his loss would severely cripple Japanese morale. The P-38 pilots flew 700 km (435 miles) at heights from 3-15 m (10-50 feet) above the ocean to avoid detection. Over the coast of Bougainville, they intercepted a formation of two Mitsubishi G4M BETTY bombers (see NASM collection) carrying the Admiral and his staff, and six Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters (see NASM collection) providing escort. The Lightning pilots downed both bombers but lost Lt. Ray Hine to a Zero. In Europe, the first Americans to down a Luftwaffe aircraft were Lt. Elza E. Shahan flying a 27th Fighter Squadron P-38E, and Lt. J. K. Shaffer flying a Curtiss P-40 (see NASM collection) in the 33rd Fighter Squadron. The two flyers shared the destruction of a Focke-Wulf Fw 200C-3 Condor maritime strike aircraft over Iceland on August 14, 1942. Later that month, the 1st fighter group accepted Lightnings and began combat operations from bases in England but this unit soon moved to fight in North Africa. More than a year passed before the P-38 reappeared over Western Europe. While the Lightning was absent, U. S. Army Air Forces strategists had relearned a painful lesson: unescorted bombers cannot operate successfully in the face of determined opposition from enemy fighters. When P-38s returned to England, the primary mission had become long-range bomber escort at ranges of about 805 kms (500 miles) and at altitudes above 6,080 m (20,000 ft). On October 15, 1943, P-38H pilots in the 55th Fighter Group flew their first combat mission over Europe at a time when the need for long-range escorts was acute. Just the day before, German fighter pilots had destroyed 60 of 291 Eighth Air Force B-17 Flying Fortresses (see NASM collection) during a mission to bomb five ball-bearing plants at Schweinfurt, Germany. No air force could sustain a loss-rate of nearly 20 percent for more than a few missions but these targets lay well beyond the range of available escort fighters (Republic P-47 Thunderbolt, see NASM collection). American war planners hoped the long-range capabilities of the P-38 Lightning could halt this deadly trend, but the very high and very cold environment peculiar to the European air war caused severe power plant and cockpit heating difficulties for the Lightning pilots. The long-range escort problem was not completely solved until the North American P-51 Mustang (see NASM collection) began to arrive in large numbers early in 1944. Poor cockpit heating in the H and J model Lightnings made flying and fighting at altitudes that frequently approached 12,320 m (40,000 ft) nearly impossible. This was a fundamental design flaw that Kelly Johnson and his team never anticipated when they designed the airplane six years earlier. In his seminal work on the Allison V-1710 engine, Daniel Whitney analyzed in detail other factors that made the P-38 a disappointing airplane in combat over Western Europe. • Many new and inexperienced pilots arrived in England during December 1943, along with the new J model P-38 Lightning. • J model rated at 1,600 horsepower vs. 1,425 for earlier H model Lightnings. This power setting required better maintenance between flights. It appears this work was not done in many cases. • During stateside training, Lightning pilots were taught to fly at high rpm settings and low engine manifold pressure during cruise flight. This was very hard on the engines, and not in keeping with technical directives issued by Allison and Lockheed. • The quality of fuel in England may have been poor, TEL (tetraethyl lead) fuel additive appeared to condense inside engine induction manifolds, causing detonation (destructive explosion of fuel mixture rather than controlled burning). • Improved turbo supercharger intercoolers appeared on the J model P-38. These devices greatly reduced manifold temperatures but this encouraged TEL condensation in manifolds during cruise flight and increased spark plug fouling. Using water injection to minimize detonation might have reduced these engine problems. Both the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt and the North American P-51 Mustang (see NASM collection) were fitted with water injection systems but not the P-38. Lightning pilots continued to fly, despite these handicaps. During November 1942, two all-Lightning fighter groups, the 1st and the 14th, began operating in North Africa. In the Mediterranean Theater, P-38 pilots flew more sorties than Allied pilots flying any other type of fighter. They claimed 608 enemy a/c destroyed in the air, 123 probably destroyed and 343 damaged, against the loss of 131 Lightnings. In the war against Japan, the P-38 truly excelled. Combat rarely occurred above 6,080 m (20,000 ft) and the engine and cockpit comfort problems common in Europe never plagued pilots in the Pacific Theater. The Lightning's excellent range was used to full advantage above the vast expanses of water. In early 1945, Lightning pilots of the 12th Fighter Squadron, 18th Fighter Group, flew a mission that lasted 10 ½ hours and covered more than 3,220 km (2,000 miles). In August, P-38 pilots established the world's long-distance record for a World War II combat fighter when they flew from the Philippines to the Netherlands East Indies, a distance of 3,703 km (2,300 miles). During early 1944, Lightning pilots in the 475th Fighter Group began the 'race of aces.' By March, Lieutenant Colonel Thomas J. Lynch had scored 21 victories before he fell to antiaircraft gunfire while strafing enemy ships. Major Thomas B. McGuire downed 38 Japanese aircraft before he was killed when his P-38 crashed at low altitude in early January 1945. Major Richard I. Bong became America's highest scoring fighter ace (40 victories) but died in the crash of a Lockheed P-80 (see NASM collection) on August 6, 1945. Museum records show that Lockheed assigned the construction number 422-2273 to the National Air and Space Museum's P-38. The Army Air Forces accepted this Lightning as a P-38J-l0-LO on November 6, 1943, and the service identified the airplane with the serial number 42-67762. Recent investigations conducted by a team of specialists at the Paul E. Garber Facility, and Herb Brownstein, a volunteer in the Aeronautics Division at the National Air and Space Museum, have revealed many hitherto unknown aspects to the history of this aircraft. Brownstein examined NASM files and documents at the National Archives. He discovered that a few days after the Army Air Forces (AAF) accepted this airplane, the Engineering Division at Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio, granted Lockheed permission to convert this P-38 into a two-seat trainer. The firm added a seat behind the pilot to accommodate an instructor who would train civilian pilots in instrument flying techniques. Once trained, these test pilots evaluated new Lightnings fresh off the assembly line. In a teletype sent by the Engineering Division on March 2, 1944, Brownstein also discovered that this P-38 was released to Colonel Benjamin S. Kelsey from March 3 to April 10, 1944, to conduct special tests. This action was confirmed the following day in a cable from the War Department. This same pilot, then a Lieutenant, flew the XP-38 across the United States in 1939 and survived the crash that destroyed this Lightning at Mitchel Field, New York. In early 1944, Kelsey was assigned to the Eighth Air Force in England and he apparently traveled to the Lockheed factory at Burbank to pick up the P-38. Further information about these tests and Kelsey's involvement remain an intriguing question. One of Brownstein's most important discoveries was a small file rich with information about the NASM Lightning. This file contained a cryptic reference to a &amp;quot;Major Bong&amp;quot; who flew the NASM P-38 on April 16, 1945, at Wright Field. Bong had planned to fly for an hour to evaluate an experimental method of interconnecting the movement of the throttle and propeller control levers. His flight ended after twenty-minutes when &amp;quot;the right engine blew up before I had a chance [to conduct the test].&amp;quot; The curator at the Richard I. Bong Heritage Center confirmed that America's highest scoring ace made this flight in the NASM P-38 Lightning. Working in Building 10 at the Paul E. Garber Facility, Rob Mawhinney, Dave Wilson, Wil Lee, Bob Weihrauch, Jim Purton, and Heather Hutton spent several months during the spring and summer of 2001 carefully disassembling, inspecting, and cleaning the NASM Lightning. They found every hardware modification consistent with a model J-25 airplane, not the model J-10 painted in the data block beneath the artifact's left nose. This fact dovetails perfectly with knowledge uncovered by Brownstein. On April 10, the Engineering Division again cabled Lockheed asking the company to prepare 42-67762 for transfer to Wright Field &amp;quot;in standard configuration.&amp;quot; The standard P-38 configuration at that time was the P-38J-25. The work took several weeks and the fighter does not appear on Wright Field records until May 15, 1944. On June 9, the Flight Test Section at Wright Field released the fighter for flight trials aimed at collecting pilot comments on how the airplane handled. Wright Field's Aeromedical Laboratory was the next organization involved with this P-38. That unit installed a kit on July 26 that probably measured the force required to move the control wheel left and right to actuate the power-boosted ailerons installed in all Lightnings beginning with version J-25. From August 12-16, the Power Plant Laboratory carried out tests to measure the hydraulic pump temperatures on this Lightning. Then beginning September 16 and lasting about ten days, the Bombing Branch, Armament Laboratory, tested type R-3 fragmentation bomb racks. The work appears to have ended early in December. On June 20, 1945, the AAF Aircraft Distribution Office asked that the Air Technical Service Command transfer the Lightning from Wright Field to Altus Air Force Base, Oklahoma, a temporary holding area for Air Force museum aircraft. The P-38 arrived at the Oklahoma City Air Depot on June 27, 1945, and mechanics prepared the fighter for flyable storage. Airplane Flight Reports for this Lightning also describe the following activities and movements: 6-21-45 Wright Field, Ohio, 5.15 hours of flying. 6-22-45Wright Field, Ohio, .35 minutes of flying by Lt. Col. Wendel [?] J. Kelley and P. Shannon. 6-25-45Altus, Oklahoma, .55 hours flown, pilot P. Shannon. 6-27-45Altus, Oklahoma, #2 engine changed, 1.05 hours flown by Air Corps F/O Ralph F.

Heckel. 7-31-46 Freeman Field, Indiana, 4120th AAF Base Unit, ferry flight to Orchard Place [Illinois] by 1st Lt. Charles C. Heckel. On August 5, 1946, the AAF moved the aircraft to another storage site at the former Consolidated B-24 bomber assembly plant at Park Ridge, Illinois. A short time later, the AAF transferred custody of the Lightning and more than sixty other World War II-era airplanes to the Smithsonian National Air Museum. During the early 1950s, the Air Force moved these airplanes from Park Ridge to the Smithsonian storage site at Suitland, Maryland. • • • Quoting from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_P-38_Lightning&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/i&gt; | &lt;b&gt;Lockheed P-38 Lightning&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: The &lt;b&gt;Lockheed P-38 Lightning&lt;/b&gt; was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; American &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_aircraft&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;fighter aircraft&lt;/a&gt; built by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Corporation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Lockheed&lt;/a&gt;.

Named &amp;quot;fork-tailed devil&amp;quot; by the &lt;i&gt;Luftwaffe&lt;/i&gt; and &amp;quot;two planes, one pilot&amp;quot; by the Japanese, the P-38 was used in a number of roles, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dive_bomber&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;dive bombing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_bomber&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;level bombing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground-attack_aircraft&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ground-attack&lt;/a&gt;, photo &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconnaissance&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reconnaissance&lt;/a&gt; missions, and extensively as a long-&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(aircraft)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;range&lt;/a&gt; escort fighter when equipped with &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_tank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;drop tanks&lt;/a&gt; under its wings.

In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_West_Pacific_theatre_of_World_War_II&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;South West Pacific theater&lt;/a&gt;, the P-38 was the primary long-range fighter of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Air_Forces&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;United States Army Air Forces&lt;/a&gt; until the appearance of large numbers of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_P-51_Mustang&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;P-51D Mustangs&lt;/a&gt; toward the end of the war. The P-38 was unusually quiet for a fighter, the exhaust muffled by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbosupercharging&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;turbo-superchargers&lt;/a&gt;. It was extremely forgiving, and could be mishandled in many ways, but the rate of roll was too slow for it to excel as a dogfighter. The P-38 was the only American fighter aircraft in production throughout American involvement in the war, from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pearl Harbor&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_over_Japan_Day&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Victory over Japan Day&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Variants: Lightning in maturity: P-38J&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The &lt;b&gt;P-38J&lt;/b&gt; was introduced in August 1943. The turbo-supercharger &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercooler&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;intercooler&lt;/a&gt; system on previous variants had been housed in the leading edges of the wings and had proven vulnerable to combat damage and could burst if the wrong series of controls were mistakenly activated. In the P-38J model, the streamlined engine nacelles of previous Lightnings were changed to fit the intercooler radiator between the oil coolers, forming a &amp;quot;chin&amp;quot; that visually distinguished the J model from its predecessors. While the P-38J used the same V-1710-89/91 engines as the H model, the new core-type intercooler more efficiently lowered intake manifold temperatures and permitted a substantial increase in rated power. The leading edge of the outer wing was fitted with 55&amp;nbsp;gal (208&amp;nbsp;l) fuel tanks, filling the space formerly occupied by intercooler tunnels, but these were omitted on early P-38J blocks due to limited availability. The final 210 J models, designated P-38J-25-LO, alleviated the compressibility problem through the addition of a set of electrically-actuated dive recovery flaps just outboard of the engines on the bottom centerline of the wings. With these improvements, a USAAF pilot reported a dive speed of almost 600&amp;nbsp;mph (970&amp;nbsp;km/h), although the indicated air speed was later corrected for compressibility error, and the actual dive speed was lower. Lockheed manufactured over 200 retrofit modification kits to be installed on P-38J-10-LO and J-20-LO already in Europe, but the USAAF C-54 carrying them was shot down by an RAF pilot who mistook the Douglas transport for a German Focke-Wulf Condor. Unfortunately the loss of the kits came during Lockheed test pilot &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_LeVier&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tony LeVier&lt;/a&gt;'s four-month morale-boosting tour of P-38 bases. Flying a new Lightning named &amp;quot;Snafuperman&amp;quot; modified to full P-38J-25-LO specs at Lockheed's modification center near Belfast, LeVier captured the pilots' full attention by routinely performing maneuvers during March 1944 that common Eighth Air Force wisdom held to be suicidal. It proved too little too late because the decision had already been made to re-equip with Mustangs. The P-38J-25-LO production block also introduced hydraulically-boosted ailerons, one of the first times such a system was fitted to a fighter. This significantly improved the Lightning's rate of roll and reduced control forces for the pilot. This production block and the following P-38L model are considered the definitive Lightnings, and Lockheed ramped up production, working with subcontractors across the country to produce hundreds of Lightnings each month. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Noted P-38 pilots&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Richard Bong and Thomas McGuire&lt;/i&gt; The American ace of aces and his closest competitor both flew Lightnings as they tallied 40 and 38 victories respectively.

Both men were awarded the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Medal of Honor&lt;/a&gt;. McGuire was killed in air combat in January 1945 over the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;, after racking up 38 confirmed kills, making him the second-ranking American ace. Bong was rotated back to the United States as America's ace of aces, after making 40 kills, becoming a test pilot. He was killed on 6 August 1945, the day the atomic bomb was dropped on Japan, when his &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-80_Shooting_Star&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;P-80 Shooting Star&lt;/a&gt; jet fighter flamed out on &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeoff&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;takeoff&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Charles Lindbergh&lt;/i&gt; The famed aviator &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Lindbergh&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Charles Lindbergh&lt;/a&gt; toured the South Pacific as a civilian contractor for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Aircraft_and_Transport_Corporation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;United Aircraft Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, comparing and evaluating performance of single- and twin-engined fighters for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vought&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Vought&lt;/a&gt;. He worked to improve range and load limits of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F4U_Corsair&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;F4U Corsair&lt;/a&gt;, flying both routine and combat strafing missions in Corsairs alongside &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps_Aviation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Marine&lt;/a&gt; pilots. In Hollandia, he attached himself to the 475th FG flying P-38s so that he could investigate the twin-engine fighter. Though new to the machine, he was instrumental in extending the range of the P-38 through improved throttle settings, or engine-leaning techniques, notably by reducing engine speed to 1,600&amp;nbsp;rpm, setting the carburetors for auto-lean and flying at 185&amp;nbsp;mph (298&amp;nbsp;km/h) &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicated_airspeed&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;indicated airspeed&lt;/a&gt; which reduced fuel consumption to 70&amp;nbsp;gal/h, about 2.6&amp;nbsp;mpg. This combination of settings had been considered dangerous; it was thought it would upset the fuel mixture and cause an explosion. Everywhere Lindbergh went in the South Pacific, he was accorded the normal preferential treatment of a visiting colonel, though he had resigned his Air Corps Reserve colonel's commission three years before. While with the 475th, he held training classes and took part in a number of Army Air Corps combat missions. On 28 July 1944, Lindbergh shot down a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_Ki-51&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Mitsubishi Ki-51&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;Sonia&amp;quot; flown expertly by the veteran commander of 73rd Independent Flying &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chutaicho&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Chutai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Army&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Imperial Japanese Army&lt;/a&gt; Captain Saburo Shimada. In an extended, twisting dogfight in which many of the participants ran out of ammunition, Shimada turned his aircraft directly toward Lindbergh who was just approaching the combat area. Lindbergh fired in a defensive reaction brought on by Shimada's apparent head-on &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramming#Air_warfare&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ramming attack&lt;/a&gt;. Hit by cannon and machine gun fire, the &amp;quot;Sonia's&amp;quot; propeller visibly slowed, but Shimada held his course. Lindbergh pulled up at the last moment to avoid collision as the damaged &amp;quot;Sonia&amp;quot; went into a steep dive, hit the ocean and sank. Lindbergh's wingman, ace Joseph E. &amp;quot;Fishkiller&amp;quot; Miller, Jr., had also scored hits on the &amp;quot;Sonia&amp;quot; after it had begun its fatal dive, but Miller was certain the kill credit was Lindbergh's. The unofficial kill was not entered in the 475th's war record. On 12 August 1944 Lindbergh left Hollandia to return to the United States. &lt;i&gt;Charles MacDonald&lt;/i&gt; The seventh-ranking American ace, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_H._MacDonald&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Charles H. MacDonald&lt;/a&gt;, flew a Lightning against the Japanese, scoring 27 kills in his famous aircraft, the &lt;i&gt;Putt Putt Maru&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Robin Olds&lt;/i&gt; Main article: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Olds&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Robin Olds&lt;/a&gt; Robin Olds was the last P-38 ace in the Eighth Air Force and the last in the ETO. Flying a P-38J, he downed five German fighters on two separate missions over France and Germany. He subsequently transitioned to P-51s to make seven more kills. After World War II, he flew F-4 Phantom IIs in Vietnam, ending his career as brigadier general with 16 kills. &lt;i&gt;Clay Tice&lt;/i&gt; A P-38 piloted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Clay_Tice&amp;amp;action=edit&amp;amp;redlink=1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Clay Tice&lt;/a&gt; was the first American aircraft to land in Japan after VJ-Day, when he and his wingman set down on Nitagahara because his wingman was low on fuel. &lt;i&gt;Antoine de Saint-Exupéry&lt;/i&gt; Noted aviation pioneer and writer &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_de_Saint-Exup%c3%a9ry&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Antoine de Saint-Exupéry&lt;/a&gt; vanished in a F-5B-1-LO, &lt;i&gt;42-68223&lt;/i&gt;, c/n 2734, of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Groupe_de_Chasse_II/33&amp;amp;action=edit&amp;amp;redlink=1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Groupe de Chasse II/33&lt;/a&gt;, out of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Borgo-Porreta&amp;amp;action=edit&amp;amp;redlink=1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Borgo-Porreta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastia&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Bastia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corsica&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Corsica&lt;/a&gt;, a reconnaissance variant of the P-38, while on a flight over the Mediterranean, from Corsica to mainland France, on 31 July 1944. His health, both physical and mental (he was said to be intermittently subject to depression), had been deteriorating and there had been talk of taking him off flight status. There have been suggestions (although no proof to date) that this was a suicide rather than an aircraft failure or combat loss.

Japanese war planners devised the idea as a means for striking directly at the United States mainland and other important strategic targets, like the Panama Canal, that lay thousands of kilometers from Japan. To support Seiran operations, the Japanese developed a fleet of submarine aircraft carriers to bring the aircraft within striking distance. No Seiran ever saw combat, but the Seiran/submarine weapons system represents an ingenious blend of aviation and marine technology. This M6A1 was the last airframe built (serial number 28) and the only surviving example of the Seiran in the world. Imperial Japanese Navy Lt. Kazuo Akatsuka ferried this Seiran from Fukuyama to Yokosuka where he surrendered it to an American occupation contingent. &lt;em&gt;Transferred from the United States Navy.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Manufacturer:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nasm.si.edu/collections/cons.cfm?id=3127&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Aichi Aircraft Company (Aichi Kokuki KK)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Date:&lt;/strong&gt; 1945 &lt;strong&gt;Country of Origin:&lt;/strong&gt; Japan &lt;strong&gt;Dimensions:&lt;/strong&gt; Overall: 460 x 1160cm, 3310kg, 1230cm (15ft 1 1/8in. x 38ft 11/16in., 7297.2lb., 40ft 4 1/4in.) &lt;strong&gt;Physical Description:&lt;/strong&gt; Wings rotated back, folded back to lie flat against the fuselage. 2/3 of each side of the horizontal stabilizer also folded down, likewise the tip of the vertical stabilizer." id="5779336130" latitude="38.911221" license="3" longitude="-77.444322" nbComments="0" rank="15" tags="eyefi somerville massachusetts unitedstates smithsonian smithsonianinstitution airandspacemuseum nationalairandspacemuseum stevenfudvarhazy stevenfudvarhazycenter dullesairport chantilly dulles fairfax virginia va udvarhazy aichim6a kawanishin1k hawker hurricane hawkerhurricane raf royalairforce fighter plane airplane aircraft worldwarii flickrstats:favorites=1 exif:aperture=f35 exif:exposure=0033sec130 exif:exposure_bias=0ev exif:filename=dsc0010jpg exif:flash=offdidnotfire exif:focal_length=18mm exif:iso_speed=1000 exif:lens=18200mmf3556 camera:make=nikoncorporation camera:model=nikond7000 exif:orientation=horizontalnormal exif:shutter_count=11525 exif:vari_program=autoflashoff meta:exif=1350345654" title="Steven F.

<photo  date_taken="2012-04-17 12:43:48" description="Declaration of Independence This painting depicts the moment on June 28, 1776, when the first draft of the Declaration of Independence was presented to the Second Continental Congress. The document stated the principles for which the Revolutionary War was being fought and which remain fundamental to the nation. Less than a week later, on July 4, 1776, the colonial delegates signed the Declaration, a milestone in American history. In the central group in the painting, Thomas Jefferson, the principal author of the Declaration, is shown placing the document before John Hancock, president of the Congress. With him stand the other members of the committee that created the draft: John Adams, Roger Sherman, Robert Livingston, and Benjamin Franklin. This event occurred in the Pennsylvania State House, now Independence Hall, in Philadelphia. This is the first completed painting of four Revolutionary-era scenes that the U.S. Congress commissioned from John Trumbull (1756–1843) in 1817. It is an enlarged version of a smaller painting (approximately 21 inches by 31 inches) that the artist had created as part of a series to document the events of the American revolution. When Trumbull was planning the smaller painting in 1786, he decided not to attempt a wholly accurate rendering of the scene; rather, he made his goal the preservation of the images of the Nation’s founders. He excluded those for whom no authoritative image could be found or created, and he included delegates who were not in attendance at the time of the event. In all, forty-seven individuals (forty-two of the fifty-six signers and five other patriots) are depicted, all painted from life or life portraits. Some of the room’s architectural features (e.g., the number and placement of doors and windows) differ from historical fact, having been based on an inaccurate sketch that Thomas Jefferson produced from memory in Paris. Trumbull also painted more elegant furniture, covered the windows with heavy draperies rather than venetian blinds, and decorated the room’s rear wall with captured British military flags, believing that such trophies were probably displayed there. The exhibition of this small painting (now owned by the Yale University art gallery) was instrumental in securing for the 61-year-old artist a commission to create monumental paintings for the Capitol. Trumbull created the enlarged painting for the Rotunda between August 1817 and September 1818. Over the next four months, he exhibited it in New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore; it was in the Capitol early in 1819 and was displayed or stored in various rooms until 1826, when it and Trumbull’s other three paintings were installed in the Rotunda. Declaration of Independence balances the last of Trumbull’s Rotunda paintings, General George Washington Resigning His Commission. The two paintings are similar in composition, with figures seated and standing in the background. The central action in each is the presentation of papers: here, by Thomas Jefferson; in Washington Resigning, by George Washington. Both scenes take place in the chambers of a civilian legislature, and Trumbull’s use of similar chairs in the two paintings subtly reinforces their relationship. Trumbull performed the first cleaning and restoration of his Rotunda paintings in 1828, applying wax to their backs to protect them from dampness and cleaning and re-varnishing their surfaces. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries the painting was cleaned, restored, varnished, and relined. All of the Rotunda paintings were most recently cleaned in 2008. An 1820 engraving of Declaration of Independence by Asher B. Durand, who would later become a renowned landscape painter, helped to make it Trumbull’s most famous painting. It is pictured on the reverse of the two-dollar bill and has appeared on U. S. postage stamps: a 24-cent stamp in the series of 1869 and two sets of bicentennial stamps in 1976 (a sheet of five 18-cent stamps and a strip of four 13-cent stamps). John Trumbull was born in Lebanon, Connecticut, on June 6, 1756. His father, Jonathan Trumbull, was later Governor of Connecticut (1769–1784). John entered Harvard College in 1771 and graduated in 1773. He created numerous sketches of significant people and places, even during his service as an officer and General Washington’s aide-de-camp during the Revolutionary War. Resigning his commission as colonel in 1777, he painted for two years and then went to England, where he studied under renowned history painter Benjamin West and at the Royal Academy of Arts. In London, Paris, and New York City, he created scenes of the American Revolution and life portraits or sketches of many of the individuals who would appear in them. He also painted portraits of other notable persons and numerous religious scenes. From 1794 to 1804, diplomatic postings in London interrupted his work, and his artistic skill suffered. However, he remained successful as a portrait painter, and exhibitions of his earlier canvases led to an 1817 commission for four large paintings to be placed in the Capitol Rotunda; these were installed in 1826, but he failed to secure a contract for additional Rotunda paintings. He returned to the religious subjects of his earlier career but fell on hard times. In 1831 he deeded many of his works to Yale College in exchange for a $1000.00 annuity. Trumbull died in New York City on November 10, 1843, and was interred beneath the art gallery at Yale that he designed. In 1867, his paintings and his remains were moved to the new art gallery (now Street Hall)." id="6951940020" latitude="38.890364" license="2" longitude="-77.028751" nbComments="0" rank="16" tags="" title="United States Capitol" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/5327/6951940020_6836f08e5b_b.jpg" username="peterjr1961" views="74" />

Trumbull died in New York City on November 10, 1843, and was interred beneath the art gallery at Yale that he designed. In 1867, his paintings and his remains were moved to the new art gallery (now Street Hall)." id="7097931115" latitude="38.890364" license="2" longitude="-77.028751" nbComments="0" rank="19" tags="" title="United States Capitol" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/7212/7097931115_429da36655_b.jpg" username="peterjr1961" views="47" />

The Gekko (meaning moonlight) was redesigned to hold only two crewmen so that an upward firing gun could be mounted where the observer once sat. Nearly five hundred J1N1 aircraft, including prototypes, escort, reconnaissance, and night fighters were built during World War II. A sizeable number were also used as Kamikaze aircraft in the Pacific. The few that survived the war were scrapped by the Allies. This J1N1 is the last remaining in the world. It was transported from Japan to the U.S. where it was flight tested by the U.S. Army Air Forces in 1946. The Gekko then flew to storage at Park Ridge, IL, and was transferred to the Smithsonian Institution. The restoration of this aircraft, completed in 1983, took more than four years and 17,000 man-hours to accomplish. &lt;em&gt;Transferred from the United States Air Force.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Manufacturer:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nasm.si.edu/collections/cons.cfm?id=2081&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Nakajima Hikoki K.

Although designed to fight in the European theater, the B-29 found its niche on the other side of the globe. In the Pacific, B-29s delivered a variety of aerial weapons: conventional bombs, incendiary bombs, mines, and two nuclear weapons. On August 6, 1945, this Martin-built B-29-45-MO dropped the first atomic weapon used in combat on Hiroshima, Japan. Three days later, Bockscar (on display at the U.S. Air Force Museum near Dayton, Ohio) dropped a second atomic bomb on Nagasaki, Japan.

<photo  date_taken="2007-08-20 18:13:10" description="Trumbull, with about four hundred twenty students, is one of the smallest and oldest of the twelve undergraduate residential colleges at Yale University. Named for Jonathan Trumbull, the last governor of the Colony of Connecticut and first governor of the State of Connecticut, and a friend and advisor to General George Washington throughout the revolutionary period, it is also one of the most picturesque. A granite fortress, it is emblematic of the Yale design, with Jacobean chimneys, gothic arches and a Norma dining hall. Trumbull was originally two free-standing dormitory buildings flanking the old gymnasium. When university President James Angell instituted the residential college system in 1933, the gym was torn down and the dormitories connected with a new building in the Gothic style, forming the Sterling Quadrangle; the fourth side of the quadrangle is Sterling Memorial Library. The new building contains the Trumbull dining hall, common room, and library, and a new dorm wing was constructed parallel to the originals. A Master's House was also constructed in the northeast corner of the quadrangle. James Gamble Rogers, the architect of none of Yale's colleges, considered the dormitories that would later be incorporated into Trumbull his magnum opus, inscribing the initials of the men who worked on the project on shield carvings along the outside of the buildings. The buildings of Trumbull are modeled after King's College, Cambridge. Three separate courtyards — Alvarez (Main) Court, Potty Court, and Stone Court — grace Trumbull's interior. The college is also home to Nick Chapel, a theater in high demand by Yale students of all colleges. Famous alumni include Anderson cooper (1989), Ron Livingston (1989), Oliver Stone, and Ian McCutheon (1978)." id="1249056522" latitude="41.310412" license="3" longitude="-72.928946" nbComments="2" rank="38" tags="connecticut newhaven ct yaleuniversity yale college campus trumbull trumbullcollege gothic collegiategothic jamesgamblerogers ivyleague ivleague" title="CT - New Haven: Yale University - Trumbull College" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/1167/1249056522_a405eed6b6_b.jpg" username="wallyg" views="1639" />

<photo  date_taken="2009-05-31 11:08:33" description="This portion of the house is the oldest. The family may have lived in portions of this structure while the big house was built. Ulitmately it was moved to the new foundation. The Nathan Hale Homestead was the home of the family of State Hero, Nathan Hale. Constructed in 1776, the current house is the second dwelling built on the property. Nathan’s father, Richard Hale, was a prosperous livestock farmer and built the house for his large family. Ardent patriots, six of Richard’s eight sons served in the patriot army. One son, Capt. Nathan Hale was caught and hanged as a spy at age 21 by the British in September of 1776. He is famous for his alleged last words, “I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country.” Following the American Revolution, three Hale sons died from wounds received in the war. Their widows and children moved to the family homestead, so that an average of 12-20 people lived in the house at any one time. The Homestead is a pristine example of a Georgian-style home. Although sold out of the Hale family in the 1820s, the house has remained virtually intact. The house was first restored by George Dudley Seymour, who saved the house in the early 20th century. Recent paint analysis has resulted in the repainting of the house interior in historic colors. The house is furnished with Hale-family pieces and period antiques and is based on the family inventories. The house was deeded to Connecticut Landmarks in the 1940s. Much of the acreage associated with the Hale farm, is now the Nathan Hale State Forest. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ctlandmarks.org/index.php?page=nathan-hale-homestead&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.ctlandmarks.org/index.php?page=nathan-hale-homestead&lt;/a&gt;" id="3591249376" latitude="41.764461" license="4" longitude="-72.346065" nbComments="24" rank="40" tags="dwelling historic nathan hale homestead coventry ct tolland bench chimney 1775 richard georgian red connecticut kitchen lilac door clapboard bulkhead" title="219.

<photo  date_taken="2008-10-14 15:55:32" description="To my fellow Washingtonians, have you ever walked past the Subway at Connecticut &amp;amp; Q and wondered about the building's history? Yeah, I didn't think so. Leave it to me, the gay nerd, to actually wonder such a thing. I did a little bit of research and found some interesting details about 1605 Connecticut Avenue, NW. Read along and learn about events that occurred in the building, including the death of a Senator's wife, marriage of a Congressman, and founding of a WW2 women's organization. On August 16, 1894 the Washington Post mentions a man by the name of L. J. Bryant, an employee of The Fidelity Investment Company, receiving building permits for a three-story, brick dwelling at 1605 Connecticut Avenue. The current facade shows four-stories, but as you'll see in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/ncindc/3015772796/&quot;&gt;older picture&lt;/a&gt;, the street level has changed and the entrance is no longer on the second floor. The estimated cost for construction was $8,000. Compare that to the 2009 property value, $2,281,870. Inflation is a bitch. By 1902, Robert F. Mason lived at 1605 Connecticut. He was a physician and member of the Medical Society of the District of Columbia. I'm not sure how long Robert had lived there before 1902, but by the end of that year, a prominent family called 1605 home. Senator &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_F._Hoar&quot;&gt;George Frisbie Hoar&lt;/a&gt; of Massachusetts purchased the building in 1902. George had served in the House of Representatives for eight years (1869-1877) prior to his election to the Senate. George was a Republican who was often at odds with his own party, especially in regards to the Philippine-American War and torture. Read an excerpt from one of his speeches on the Senate floor. Notice anything similar to our current situation? &amp;quot;You have sacrificed nearly ten thousand American lives—the flower of our youth. You have devastated provinces. You have slain uncounted thousands of the people you desire to benefit. You have established reconcentration camps. Your generals are coming home from their harvest bringing sheaves with them, in the shape of other thousands of sick and wounded and insane to drag out miserable lives, wrecked in body and mind. You make the American flag in the eyes of a numerous people the emblem of sacrilege in Christian churches, and of the burning of human dwellings, and of the horror of the water torture. Your practical statesmanship which disdains to take George Washington and Abraham Lincoln or the soldiers of the Revolution or of the Civil War as models, has looked in some cases to Spain for your example. I believe—nay, I know—that in general our officers and soldiers are humane. But in some cases they have carried on your warfare with a mixture of American ingenuity and Castilian cruelty. Your practical statesmanship has succeeded in converting a people who three years ago were ready to kiss the hem of the garment of the American and to welcome him as a liberator, who thronged after your men when they landed on those islands with benediction and gratitude, into sullen and irreconcilable enemies, possessed of a hatred which centuries can not eradicate.&amp;quot; I won't list all of George's noteworthy relatives (you can read about them on the Wikipedia article), but his grandfather, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Sherman&quot;&gt;Roger Sherman&lt;/a&gt;, signed the Articles of Confederation, Declaration of Independence, and Constitution. George's wife, Ruth, died not long after they moved into their 1605 residence. A Washington Post article on December 25. 1903 says Ruth &amp;quot;died very suddenly of heart disease&amp;quot; (heart attack) at 9 p.m. on Christmas Eve. The article mentions that she died in her house. So if you see a floating, six-inch meatball marinara the next time you eat at Subway, now you know it's the ghost of Ruth Hoar trying to scare you. George died the following year and ownership of 1605 transferred to his son, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwood_Hoar&quot;&gt;Rockwood&lt;/a&gt;. Rockwood was elected to the House of Representatives in 1904, but died just two years later. His widow, Christine Rice Hoar, continued to live at 1605. A New York Times article on November 25, 1915 reported the marriage of Christine to Rep. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_H._Gillett&quot;&gt;Frederick H. Gillet&lt;/a&gt;. The two were married at 1605 Connecticut with only a few family members present. Roland Cotton Smith, pastor of &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/ncindc/2686541756/&quot;&gt;St. John's Episcopal Church&lt;/a&gt;, presided over the ceremony. I'm not sure who lived in the building during the next 25 years, but by 1940 the newly-incorporated American Women's Voluntary Services was using 1605 as its national headquarters. Founded by Alice T. McLean, the organization was modeled after the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Voluntary_Services&quot;&gt;Women's Voluntary Service&lt;/a&gt; in the UK. On January 30, 1941, a Washington Post article mentions that more than 10,000 women in &amp;quot;sixteen states and Alaska&amp;quot; were working in the AWVS. That number increased to 18,000 by the time Pearl Harbor was attacked. Skip ahead a few years and we come to Mills Astin. He was a WW2 veteran and Chief Clerk for the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. The 1952 Congressional Directory lists his residence as 1605 Connecticut Avenue. By the 1970s, the building was being used for commercial purposes. Current tenants include Subway (1st floor), The Eloft (2nd floor), Campaign for Innocent Victims of Conflict (3rd floor), and Free Range Studios (4th floor). It's now a contributing property to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/wash/dc50.htm&quot;&gt;Dupont Circle Historic District&lt;/a&gt;. So, now you know a few interesting facts you can tell the cashier at Subway. I'm sure he or she will be so &amp;quot;interested,&amp;quot; but that's okay. At least you can tell them about Ruth and hope it freaks them out.

<photo  date_taken="2009-05-19 01:38:19" description="White Cliffs, the original Wesson Estate, was built in 1886 by Daniel Wesson, Smith and Wesson Firearms Magnate, for his wife, Cynthia. The mansion served as the Wesson's Summer home for eighteen years. Originally built on a sprawling hundred acres with thirty-two rooms and seventeen fireplaces; today, White Cliffs is one of the area's premier function facilities. According to the company's website: &amp;quot;Born on May 18, 1825 in Worcester, Massachusetts, Daniel Wesson was one of ten children born to Mr. and Mrs. Rufus Wesson. At age 18, he was apprenticed by his father to Daniel's two older brothers who ran a shoe manufacturing company in Worcester. Daniel later bought out of his apprenticeship to join another brother, Edwin, who owned a small firearms factory in Northborough, not far from the present White Cliffs. It was at this time that he met Miss Cynthia Hawes, whom he would eventually marry. In 1847, the factory was moved to Hartford, Connecticut. Daniel and Cynthia eloped and made 37 Pleasant Street in Hartford their home. Daniel continued to work for his brother as a journeyman gunsmith until Edwin's death in 1849. In 1852, Daniel met Horace Smith. They formed a partnership in 1853 and began the first Smith and Wesson factory. In 1857, the factory was moved to Springfield, Massachusetts and Wesson patented the famed repeating action cartridge revolver. With the outbreak of the Civil War, Daniel Wesson's business reached new heights. He then began to sell his arms to the rest of the world and become one of the wealthiest industrialists in the United States. At Cynthia Wesson's request, Daniel purchased a large estate in Northborough in 1886 and built a magnificent home across the street from his mother-in-law's modest dwelling. White Cliffs was said to have cost three hundred thousand dollars to build. Skilled craftsmen from Italy were employed to work on the imported tropical woods and marbles used in the mansion. Each room was of a different design with the furniture made from the same wood used in the room. Wesson's inventive nature was involved in the construction of an aqueduct and pumping station which supplied hot and cold running water to every bedroom in the mansion. The Wessons traveled from Springfield to White Cliffs in May of each year by horse and buggy with their grandchildren. They spent the Summer months in Northborough, returning to Springfield in October. In 1906, after fifty-nine years of marriage, Daniel and Cynthia Wesson died within two weeks of each other. White Cliffs was left to their children, who sold it in 1910. There have been several owners over the years.

She was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the first daughter of Samuel Davenport Torrey (1789-1877) and his second wife, the former Susan Holman Waters (1803-1866). Her three sisters were Delia Chapin Torrey (who married geologist Edward Orton), Anna Davenport Torrey, and Susan H. Torrey. She graduated from Mount Holyoke College (then Mount Holyoke Female Seminary) in 1845. She married Alphonso Taft, widowed in 1852, on 26 December 1853 in Millbury, Massachusetts, becoming stepmother to his two living sons by his first wife, Fanny Phelps, Charles Phelps Taft, who became the publisher of the Cincinnati Times-Star and was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1895 to 1897, and Peter Rawson &amp;quot;Rossy&amp;quot; Taft. Alphonso and Louisa had five children, four of whom lived to adulthood. The first, who died aged 14 months of pertussis, was Samuel Davenport Torrey Taft. The second was President William Howard Taft; next was Henry Waters Taft, who became a lawyer in New York City; fourth was Horace Dutton Taft, founder of the Taft School in Watertown, Connecticut, and the last was Frances Louis &amp;quot;Fanny&amp;quot; Taft, who married surgeon William A. Edwards. The family lived in Cincinnati during her husband's tenure as judge of the Superior Court of Cincinnati, in Washington, D. C. when he was, successively, Secretary of War and Attorney General and in Austria-Hungary and Russia when he served as U.S. ambassador there. Louise Taft died at Millbury, Massachusetts aged 80 years, and was interred at Spring Grove Cemetery, in Cincinnati, Ohio.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www25.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/alphonsotaft.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Alphonso Taft&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt; (November 5, 1810-May 21, 1891), one of Cincinnati's most prominent citizens and among Ohio's most highly regarded 19th-century attorneys and jurists, wrote an influential dissent on Ohio's &amp;quot;Bible in the Schools Case.&amp;quot; He was the progenitor of a family politically influential in both Ohio and Washington. During his more than forty years as a member of First Congregational Church (Unitarian) his devotion and service to the congregation made him a pillar of the church. Alphonso was born in Townshend, Vermont, son of Sylvia Howard and Peter Rawson Taft, a farmer, lawyer, and local judge. The Tafts' only child received the best available public school education, and his parents encouraged him as he worked to pay his way through Amherst Academy and Yale College by teaching high school. He graduated from Yale in 1833, third out of 90. He taught high school again, and tutored college students, in order to attend Yale Law School. He graduated in 1838. Following an exploratory trip to the West in 1838-39, he moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, where he apprenticed at a law office. Admitted to the Ohio bar in 1840, he set up practice. His legal success led to service on the Cincinnati City Council for five years during the 1840s. In 1841 Taft married Fanny Phelps, the daughter of family friends in Vermont. They had five children; two survived early childhood. After Fanny died in 1852, Alphonso's parents came to live with him and his two sons. In 1853 Alphonso married Louise Torrey, daughter of prominent Milbury, Massachusetts parents. They had four sons and a daughter. The first son died in childhood; the second, born in 1857, was William Howard Taft, later the twenty-fifth president of the United States. All of Alphonso Taft's sons graduated from Yale. Although Taft had been brought up a Baptist, he had no religious affiliation when he first settled in Cincinnati. He attended Baptist services occasionally with Fanny and heard some of Lyman Beecher's sermons at 2nd Presbyterian Church. In the mid-1840s he discovered First Congregational Church (Unitarian), whose services and members he found congenial. He joined in 1847 or 1848 and Fanny became a member shortly thereafter. Taft's second wife, Louise, who had been brought up as Unitarian, became an active member in the Cincinnati church. Taft was active in Whig politics until the party dissolved because of the slavery issue. In 1855 he was a founder the national Republican Party and its Ohio affiliate. He remained active in Ohio Republican politics for the next 34 years. In 1865 Taft was appointed to fill an unexpired term as a Judge of the Superior Court of Cincinnati (part of the Ohio State Court System). He was subsequently elected to two terms. One of Taft's opinions as a judge, against Bible-reading in public schools, remains meaningful today. Several other local Unitarians, including members of his church, were actors in the drama that led to a landmark decision about church and state. Since 1829, when the public school system in Cincinnati was founded, daily reading of the King James Bible and the singing of Protestant hymns had been the custom in each schoolroom. This went unchallenged until Archbishop John Baptist Purcell objected on behalf of the thousands of Catholic children in the system. By the late 1860s Archbishop Purcell's protest had been seconded by Rabbis Isaac M. Wise and Max Lilienthal on behalf of Cincinnati's substantial population of Reform Jews. The Board of Education was divided over proposals to end the practice. The only two clergymen on the Board were Unitarian ministers, the ultra-liberal Thomas Vickers of First Congregational Church and conservative Amory Dwight Mayo of the Church of the Redeemer. The former was the leading spokesman for the Unitarians and for Cincinnati's large number of freethinkers; and the latter was equally prominent as an advocate for the pro Bible-reading forces. It is a supreme irony that the leading spokesmen on this contentious issue, in one of the most religiously heterogeneous cities in the country, were two Unitarian ministers. In 1869 the Board of Education voted in favor of excluding Bible-reading from the public schools. Two days after, a large group of prominent citizens successfully petitioned Judge Bellamy Storer, of the Superior Court of Cincinnati, to issue a temporary injunction preventing the Board from implementing its decision. A few weeks later, a trial was held before a three-judge panel of the Superior Court to decide whether the injunction should be vacated or made permanent. The entire controversy and the ensuing trial were covered intensively by the nation's leading newspapers. Two of the three judges were leading conservative Protestant laymen. The third was Alphonso Taft. Among the anti-Bible-reading attorneys was former judge George Hoadly, Cincinnati's leading corporate attorney, a future governor of Ohio, and a longtime member of First Congregational Church. The outcome of the trial was a permanent injunction on the Board of Education allowing continued Bible-reading in the schools. Taft wrote a significant dissenting opinion on the Bible in the Schools Case. &amp;quot;I can not doubt,&amp;quot; he wrote, &amp;quot;that the use of the Bible with the appropriate singing, provided for by the old rule, and as practiced under it, was and is sectarian. It is Protestant worship. And its use is a symbol of Protestant supremacy in the schools, and as such offensive to Catholics and to Jews. They have a constitutional right to object to it, as a legal preference given by the state to the Protestant sects, which is forbidden by the Constitution. . . . When the Board of Education, therefore, which represents the civil power of the State in the schools, finds objection made to the use of the Protestant Bible and Protestant singing of Protestant hymns, on conscientious grounds, and concludes to dispense with the practice in the schools, it is no just ground to charge on the Board hostility to the Bible, or to the Protestant religion, or to religion in general. The Bible is not banished, nor is religion degraded or abused. The Board has simply aimed to free the common schools from any just conscientious objections, by confining them to secular instruction, and moral and intellectual training.&amp;quot; Although Taft's eloquent dissent was of no immediate avail, the controversy continued until the Ohio Supreme Court reversed the ruling in 1873. Its unanimous decision upheld Taft's dissent. This remains an important precedent in Establishment of Religion law. In 1876 President Grant, in an effort to put a clean face at the head of a corruption-plagued department, appointed Taft Secretary of War. Mercifully, later that year he made Taft Attorney General, in which capacity he served with distinction until the end of the administration. He was the leading contender for the Republican Party nomination for Governor in 1875 and 1879. He lost each time at the convention, largely because his opinion on the Bible in the Schools Case was intensely disliked by the evangelical Protestants. In 1882 he was appointed ambassador to the Austro-Hungarian Empire and, in 1884, ambassador to Russia. He retired in 1885 due to illness, and resumed private practice. Five years later, for health reasons, he retired to San Diego, California, where he died.&lt;/i&gt;" id="6659112591" latitude="0" license="3" longitude="0" nbComments="0" rank="43" tags="taftnationalhistoricsite house williamhowardtaft cincinnati ohio louisataft portrait parlor" title="Portrait of Louisa Taft" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/7029/6659112591_28ca1413ff_b.jpg" username="elycefeliz" views="355" />

Over the course of this week, several hundred events are taking place in big and small towns across the country. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- PUBLIC SERVICE: Then (CCC) and Now (AmeriCorps VISTA). In 1932, when the American public voted President Herbert Hoover out of office, they were searching for an end to the economic chaos and unemployment that had gripped the nation for two years. They turned to a man promising a better life than the one they had known since the beginning of the Great Depression — Franklin D. Roosevelt. When FDR took office, he immediately commenced a massive revitalization of the nation's economy. In response to the depression that hung over the nation in the early 1930s, President Roosevelt created many programs designed to put Americans back to work. Roosevelt was not interested in the dole. He was was determined, rather, to preserve the pride of American workers in their own ability to earn a living, so he concentrated on creating jobs. In his first 100 days in office, President Roosevelt approved several measures as part of his &amp;quot;New Deal,&amp;quot; including the Emergency Conservation Work Act (ECW), better known as the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). With that action, he brought together the nation's young men and the land in an effort to save them both. Roosevelt proposed to recruit thousands of unemployed young men, enlist them in a peacetime army, and send them to battle the erosion and destruction of the nation's natural resources. More than any other New Deal agency, the CCC is considered to be an extension of Roosevelt's personal philosophy. The speed with which the plan moved through proposal, authorization, implementation, and operation was certainly a miracle of cooperation among all the agencies and branches of the federal government. From FDR's inauguration on March 4, 1933, to the induction of the first CCC enrollee, only 37 days had elapsed. The CCC, also known as Roosevelt's Tree Army, was credited with renewing the nation's decimated forests by planting an estimated three billion trees from 1933 to 1942. This was crucial, especially in states affected by the Dust Bowl, where reforestation was necessary to break the wind, hold water in the soil, and hold the soil in place. So far reaching was the CCC's reforestation program that it was responsible for more than half the reforestation, public and private, accomplish in the nation's history. Now recognized as the single greatest conservation program in America, the CCC served as a catalyst to develop the very tenets of modern conservation. The work of America's young men dramatically changed the future and today we still enjoy a legacy of natural resource treasures that dot the American landscape. CCC Projects: - More than 3,470 fire towers erected; - 97,000 miles of fire roads built; - 4,235,000 man-days devoted to fighting fires; - More than 3 billion trees planted; - 7,153,000 man days expended on protecting the natural habitats of wildlife; 83 camps in 15 Western states assigned 45 projects of that nature; - 46 camps assigned to work under the direction of the U.S. Bureau of Agriculture Engineering; - More than 84,400,000 acres of good agricultural land receive manmade drainage systems; American Indian enrollees do much of that work; - 1,240,000 man-days of emergency work completed during floods of the Ohio and Mississippi valleys; - Disease and insect control; - Forest improvement — timber stand inventories, surveying, and reforestation; - Forest recreation development — campgrounds built, complete with picnic shelters, swimming pools, fireplaces, and restrooms. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Community service and volunteerism have always been a vital force in American life. Throughout history, our nation has relied on the dedication and action of citizens to tackle our biggest challenges. In 1963, President John F. Kennedy envisioned a national service corps “to help provide urgently needed services in urban and rural poverty areas.” Less than two years later, President Lyndon B. Johnson realized Kennedy's dream by launching the “War on Poverty.” Johnson welcomed the first group of 20 VISTA volunteers saying, “Your pay will be low; the conditions of your labor often will be difficult. But you will have the satisfaction of leading a great national effort and you will have the ultimate reward which comes to those who serve their fellow man.” VISTA, like Head Start and other lasting antipoverty programs, was created by The Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 to serve the needs of the poorest Americans. The first VISTA members started in January 1965, and by the end of the year more than 2,000 members were working in the Appalachian region, California migrant worker camps, and Hartford, Connecticut poor neighborhoods. By 1966, more than 3,600 VISTA members were serving the country. By the end of its first decade, VISTA had helped develop a range of projects around the United States, including block watch clubs, credit unions, agricultural cooperatives, community groups, and small businesses. Many of these entities still thrive today—including some of the first Head Start programs and Job Corps sites. As experience with poverty issues grew, VISTA also recruited lawyers, doctors, and architects to work in underserved areas. In the 1970s, VISTA merged with Peace Corps and the National Senior Service programs, and the ACTION agency was born. As experience with poverty issues grew, VISTA recruited professionals trained in specific skills. Doctors helped develop new health care facilities, architects helped renovate and build low-income housing, and lawyers encouraged housing and health care reform. In the 1980s, the program placed a strong focus on literacy, substance abuse prevention and treatment, citizen participation, and community self-help. The 1990s saw a resurgence of national service. In 1990, President George H. Bush developed the Commission on National and Community Service. With the signing of the National Community Service Trust Act in 1993, President William Clinton expanded national service to create AmeriCorps. The programs merged to create AmeriCorps VISTA. Throughout the 1990s, AmeriCorps VISTA continued the long tradition of starting new and innovative programs. VISTA members helped develop low-income housing cooperatives, created programs to help people transition from welfare to work, expanded Individual Development Accounts to help people save money, and provide constructive out-of-school activities for disadvantaged youth. Throughout the decades, VISTA evolved to respond to local problems and the changing face of poverty. Today, under President Barack Obama, VISTA is larger, stronger, and more vital than it has ever been. Its 6,500 members—who serve at 1,200 projects nationwide—continue to address the root causes of poverty. They are developing new programs, raising funds, helping manage projects, and otherwise building the capacity of nonprofit organizations to become sustainable and of families to break the cycle of poverty. They also are setting the standard for volunteer mobilization and leading the charge to answer President’s Obama's call for every American to become engaged in their community through volunteer service. In 2010, nearly 650,000 AmeriCorps members have committed more than 700 million hours to addressing real problems in communities – from soaring dropout rates to unemployment and disaster recovery – since 1994. Every federal dollar invested in AmeriCorps programs helps rebuild local economies, build stronger communities, and meet the needs of our nation’s most vulnerable citizens. Last year alone, AmeriCorps recruited over 2.4 million community volunteers, raised over $183 million in support of local service initiatives, and helped place more than 7,700 people in jobs. Interest in AmeriCorps is at an all time high, with applications to join the program tripling over the past year. The Corporation for National and Community Service is a federal agency that engages more than five million Americans in service through its Senior Corps, AmeriCorps, and Learn and Serve America programs, and leads President Obama's national call to service initiative, United We Serve.

In May Morgan Stanley raised $4 billion for its new infrastructure fund, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR), a private-equity firm, launched a global infrastructure practice, and Pennsylvania announced that Citigroup and Abertis, a Spanish toll-road operator, had won an auction to lease the state’s turnpike.

America has a grand tradition of national planning, from Thomas Jefferson’s vision for roads and canals in 1808, which influenced policy for the next century (and led to America’s first transcontinental railway) to Dwight Eisenhower’s Federal Highway-Aid Act of 1956, which created the interstate system. Such plans stand in stark contrast to the federal government’s strategy today. America invests a mere 2.4% of GDP in infrastructure, compared with 5% in Europe and 9% in China, and the distribution of that money is misguided. The more roads and drivers a state has, the more federal money it receives, explains Judith Rodin of the Rockefeller Foundation, which funds infrastructure research. This discourages states from trying to cut traffic. And because the petrol tax pays for transport projects, if America drives less, there is less money for infrastructure. Even worse is the influence of the pork-barrel. Only around 20 states use cost-benefit analyses to evaluate transport projects; of these, just six do so regularly. Alaska’s “bridge to nowhere” is an infamous result of this sort of planning. But it is not exceptional. Two months after the bridge collapsed in Minneapolis, the Senate approved a transport and housing bill that included money for a stadium in Montana and a museum in Las Vegas. The result is disarray. America’s ageing water infrastructure is sorely underfunded: the Environmental Protection Agency forecasts an $11 billion annual gap in meeting costs over the next 20 years. One heavy storm can cause ageing urban sewerage systems to overflow. Last summer an 83-year-old pipe in Manhattan burst, sending a geyser of steam and debris into the air.

Although a growing number of Americans are travelling by train, the railways are old. America’s only “high-speed” train runs between Boston and Washington, DC, on an inadequate track. How can all this be fixed? In January a national commission on transport policy recommended that the government should invest at least $225 billion each year for the next 50 years. The country is spending less than 40% of that amount today. Yet more important than spending lots of money is spending it in better ways. The Brookings Institution, a think-tank, recommends that America focus on metropolitan areas, or “metros”, the top 100 of which account for 65% of population and 75% of economic output. “America 2050”, led by the RPA and a committee of scholars and civic leaders, has a similar scheme for “megaregions”, or networks of metros.

<photo  date_taken="2010-11-12 19:51:10" description="view large Judicial Watch, the public interest group that investigates and prosecutes government corruption, today released its 2009 list of Washington's &amp;quot;Ten Most Wanted Corrupt Politicians.&amp;quot; The list, in alphabetical order, includes: 1. Senator Christopher Dodd (D-CT): This marks two years in a row for Senator Dodd, who made the 2008 &amp;quot;Ten Most Corrupt&amp;quot; list for his corrupt relationship with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and for accepting preferential treatment and loan terms from Countrywide Financial, a scandal which still dogs him. In 2009, the scandals kept coming for the Connecticut Democrat. In 2009, Judicial Watch filed a Senate ethics complaint against Dodd for undervaluing a property he owns in Ireland on his Senate Financial Disclosure forms. Judicial Watch's complaint forced Dodd to amend the forms. However, press reports suggest the property to this day remains undervalued. Judicial Watch also alleges in the complaint that Dodd obtained a sweetheart deal for the property in exchange for his assistance in obtaining a presidential pardon (during the Clinton administration) and other favors for a long-time friend and business associate. The false financial disclosure forms were part of the cover-up. Dodd remains the head the Senate Banking Committee. 2. Senator John Ensign (R-NV): A number of scandals popped up in 2009 involving public officials who conducted illicit affairs, and then attempted to cover them up with hush payments and favors, an obvious abuse of power. The year's worst offender might just be Nevada Republican Senator John Ensign. Ensign admitted in June to an extramarital affair with the wife of one of his staff members, who then allegedly obtained special favors from the Nevada Republican in exchange for his silence. According to The New York Times: &amp;quot;The Justice Department and the Senate Ethics Committee are expected to conduct preliminary inquiries into whether Senator John Ensign violated federal law or ethics rules as part of an effort to conceal an affair with the wife of an aide…&amp;quot; The former staffer, Douglas Hampton, began to lobby Mr. Ensign's office immediately upon leaving his congressional job, despite the fact that he was subject to a one-year lobbying ban. Ensign seems to have ignored the law and allowed Hampton lobbying access to his office as a payment for his silence about the affair. (These are potentially criminal offenses.) It looks as if Ensign misused his public office (and taxpayer resources) to cover up his sexual shenanigans. 3. Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA): Judicial Watch is investigating a $12 million TARP cash injection provided to the Boston-based OneUnited Bank at the urging of Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank. As reported in the January 22, 2009, edition of the Wall Street Journal, the Treasury Department indicated it would only provide funds to healthy banks to jump-start lending. Not only was OneUnited Bank in massive financial turmoil, but it was also &amp;quot;under attack from its regulators for allegations of poor lending practices and executive-pay abuses, including owning a Porsche for its executives' use.&amp;quot; Rep. Frank admitted he spoke to a &amp;quot;federal regulator,&amp;quot; and Treasury granted the funds. (The bank continues to flounder despite Frank's intervention for federal dollars.) Moreover, Judicial Watch uncovered documents in 2009 that showed that members of Congress for years were aware that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were playing fast and loose with accounting issues, risk assessment issues and executive compensation issues, even as liberals led by Rep. Frank continued to block attempts to rein in the two Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs). For example, during a hearing on September 10, 2003, before the House Committee on Financial Services considering a Bush administration proposal to further regulate Fannie and Freddie, Rep. Frank stated: &amp;quot;I want to begin by saying that I am glad to consider the legislation, but I do not think we are facing any kind of a crisis. That is, in my view, the two Government Sponsored Enterprises we are talking about here, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not in a crisis. We have recently had an accounting problem with Freddie Mac that has led to people being dismissed, as appears to be appropriate. I do not think at this point there is a problem with a threat to the Treasury.&amp;quot; Frank received $42,350 in campaign contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac between 1989 and 2008. Frank also engaged in a relationship with a Fannie Mae Executive while serving on the House Banking Committee, which has jurisdiction over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 4. Secretary of Treasury Timothy Geithner: In 2009, Obama Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner admitted that he failed to pay $34,000 in Social Security and Medicare taxes from 2001-2004 on his lucrative salary at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), an organization with 185 member countries that oversees the global financial system. (Did we mention Geithner now runs the IRS?) It wasn't until President Obama tapped Geithner to head the Treasury Department that he paid back most of the money, although the IRS kindly waived the hefty penalties. In March 2009, Geithner also came under fire for his handling of the AIG bonus scandal, where the company used $165 million of its bailout funds to pay out executive bonuses, resulting in a massive public backlash. Of course as head of the New York Federal Reserve, Geithner helped craft the AIG deal in September 2008. However, when the AIG scandal broke, Geithner claimed he knew nothing of the bonuses until March 10, 2009. The timing is important. According to CNN: &amp;quot;Although Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told congressional leaders on Tuesday that he learned of AIG's impending $160 million bonus payments to members of its troubled financial-products unit on March 10, sources tell TIME that the New York Federal Reserve informed Treasury staff that the payments were imminent on Feb. 28. That is ten days before Treasury staffers say they first learned 'full details' of the bonus plan, and three days before the [Obama] Administration launched a new $30 billion infusion of cash for AIG.&amp;quot; Throw in another embarrassing disclosure in 2009 that Geithner employed &amp;quot;household help&amp;quot; ineligible to work in the United States, and it becomes clear why the Treasury Secretary has earned a spot on the &amp;quot;Ten Most Corrupt Politicians in Washington&amp;quot; list. 5. Attorney General Eric Holder: Tim Geithner can be sure he won't be hounded about his tax-dodging by his colleague Eric Holder, US Attorney General. Judicial Watch strongly opposed Holder because of his terrible ethics record, which includes: obstructing an FBI investigation of the theft of nuclear secrets from Los Alamos Nuclear Laboratory; rejecting multiple requests for an independent counsel to investigate alleged fundraising abuses by then-Vice President Al Gore in the Clinton White House; undermining the criminal investigation of President Clinton by Kenneth Starr in the midst of the Lewinsky investigation; and planning the violent raid to seize then-six-year-old Elian Gonzalez at gunpoint in order to return him to Castro's Cuba. Moreover, there is his soft record on terrorism. Holder bypassed Justice Department procedures to push through Bill Clinton's scandalous presidential pardons and commutations, including for 16 members of FALN, a violent Puerto Rican terrorist group that orchestrated approximately 120 bombings in the United States, killing at least six people and permanently maiming dozens of others, including law enforcement officers. His record in the current administration is no better. As he did during the Clinton administration, Holder continues to ignore serious incidents of corruption that could impact his political bosses at the White House. For example, Holder has refused to investigate charges that the Obama political machine traded VIP access to the White House in exchange for campaign contributions – a scheme eerily similar to one hatched by Holder's former boss, Bill Clinton in the 1990s. The Holder Justice Department also came under fire for dropping a voter intimidation case against the New Black Panther Party. On Election Day 2008, Black Panthers dressed in paramilitary garb threatened voters as they approached polling stations. Holder has also failed to initiate a comprehensive Justice investigation of the notorious organization ACORN (Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now), which is closely tied to President Obama. There were allegedly more than 400,000 fraudulent ACORN voter registrations in the 2008 campaign. And then there were the journalist videos catching ACORN Housing workers advising undercover reporters on how to evade tax, immigration, and child prostitution laws. Holder's controversial decisions on new rights for terrorists and his attacks on previous efforts to combat terrorism remind many of the fact that his former law firm has provided and continues to provide pro bono representation to terrorists at Guantanamo Bay. Holder's politicization of the Justice Department makes one long for the days of Alberto Gonzales. 6. Rep. Jesse Jackson, Jr. (D-IL)/ Senator Roland Burris (D-IL): One of the most serious scandals of 2009 involved a scheme by former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich to sell President Obama's then-vacant Senate seat to the highest bidder. Two men caught smack dab in the middle of the scandal: Senator Roland Burris, who ultimately got the job, and Rep. Jesse Jackson, Jr. According to the Chicago Sun-Times, emissaries for Jesse Jackson Jr., named &amp;quot;Senate Candidate A&amp;quot; in the Blagojevich indictment, reportedly offered $1.5 million to Blagojevich during a fundraiser if he named Jackson Jr. to Obama's seat. Three days later federal authorities arrested Blagojevich. Burris, for his part, apparently lied about his contacts with Blagojevich, who was arrested in December 2008 for trying to sell Obama's Senate seat. According to Reuters: &amp;quot;Roland Burris came under fresh scrutiny…after disclosing he tried to raise money for the disgraced former Illinois governor who named him to the U.S. Senate seat once held by President Barack Obama…In the latest of those admissions, Burris said he looked into mounting a fundraiser for Rod Blagojevich -- later charged with trying to sell Obama's Senate seat -- at the same time he was expressing interest to the then-governor's aides about his desire to be appointed.&amp;quot; Burris changed his story five times regarding his contacts with Blagojevich prior to the Illinois governor appointing him to the U.S. Senate. Three of those changing explanations came under oath. 7. President Barack Obama: During his presidential campaign, President Obama promised to run an ethical and transparent administration. However, in his first year in office, the President has delivered corruption and secrecy, bringing Chicago-style political corruption to the White House. Consider just a few Obama administration &amp;quot;lowlights&amp;quot; from year one: Even before President Obama was sworn into office, he was interviewed by the FBI for a criminal investigation of former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich's scheme to sell the President's former Senate seat to the highest bidder. (Obama's Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and slumlord Valerie Jarrett, both from Chicago, are also tangled up in the Blagojevich scandal.) Moreover, the Obama administration made the startling claim that the Privacy Act does not apply to the White House. The Obama White House believes it can violate the privacy rights of American citizens without any legal consequences or accountability. President Obama boldly proclaimed that &amp;quot;transparency and the rule of law will be the touchstones of this presidency,&amp;quot; but his administration is addicted to secrecy, stonewalling far too many of Judicial Watch's Freedom of Information Act requests and is refusing to make public White House visitor logs as federal law requires. The Obama administration turned the National Endowment of the Arts (as well as the agency that runs the AmeriCorps program) into propaganda machines, using tax dollars to persuade &amp;quot;artists&amp;quot; to promote the Obama agenda. According to documents uncovered by Judicial Watch, the idea emerged as a direct result of the Obama campaign and enjoyed White House approval and participation. President Obama has installed a record number of &amp;quot;czars&amp;quot; in positions of power. Too many of these individuals are leftist radicals who answer to no one but the president. And too many of the czars are not subject to Senate confirmation (which raises serious constitutional questions). Under the President's bailout schemes, the federal government continues to appropriate or control — through fiat and threats — large sectors of the private economy, prompting conservative columnist George Will to write: &amp;quot;The administration's central activity — the political allocation of wealth and opportunity — is not merely susceptible to corruption, it is corruption.&amp;quot; Government-run healthcare and car companies, White House coercion, uninvestigated ACORN corruption, debasing his office to help Chicago cronies, attacks on conservative media and the private sector, unprecedented and dangerous new rights for terrorists, perks for campaign donors — this is Obama's &amp;quot;ethics&amp;quot; record — and we haven't even gotten through the first year of his presidency. 8. Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA): At the heart of the corruption problem in Washington is a sense of entitlement. Politicians believe laws and rules (even the U.S. Constitution) apply to the rest of us but not to them. Case in point: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her excessive and boorish demands for military travel. Judicial Watch obtained documents from the Pentagon in 2009 that suggest Pelosi has been treating the Air Force like her own personal airline. These documents, obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, include internal Pentagon email correspondence detailing attempts by Pentagon staff to accommodate Pelosi's numerous requests for military escorts and military aircraft as well as the speaker's 11th hour cancellations and changes. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also came under fire in April 2009, when she claimed she was never briefed about the CIA's use of the waterboarding technique during terrorism investigations. The CIA produced a report documenting a briefing with Pelosi on September 4, 2002, that suggests otherwise. Judicial Watch also obtained documents, including a CIA Inspector General report, which further confirmed that Congress was fully briefed on the enhanced interrogation techniques. Aside from her own personal transgressions, Nancy Pelosi has ignored serious incidents of corruption within her own party, including many of the individuals on this list. (See Rangel, Murtha, Jesse Jackson, Jr., etc.) 9. Rep. John Murtha (D-PA) and the rest of the PMA Seven: Rep. John Murtha made headlines in 2009 for all the wrong reasons. The Pennsylvania congressman is under federal investigation for his corrupt relationship with the now-defunct defense lobbyist PMA Group. PMA, founded by a former Murtha associate, has been the congressman's largest campaign contributor. Since 2002, Murtha has raised $1.7 million from PMA and its clients. And what did PMA and its clients receive from Murtha in return for their generosity? Earmarks -- tens of millions of dollars in earmarks. In fact, even with all of the attention surrounding his alleged influence peddling, Murtha kept at it. Following an FBI raid of PMA's offices earlier in 2009, Murtha continued to seek congressional earmarks for PMA clients, while also hitting them up for campaign contributions. According to The Hill, in April, &amp;quot;Murtha reported receiving contributions from three former PMA clients for whom he requested earmarks in the pending appropriations bills.&amp;quot; When it comes to the PMA scandal, Murtha is not alone. As many as six other Members of Congress are currently under scrutiny according to The Washington Post. They include: Peter J. Visclosky (D-IN.), James P. Moran Jr. (D-VA), Norm Dicks (D-WA.), Marcy Kaptur (D-OH), C.W. Bill Young (R-FL.) and Todd Tiahrt (R-KS.). Of course rather than investigate this serious scandal, according to Roll Call House Democrats circled the wagons, &amp;quot;cobbling together a defense to offer political cover to their rank and file.&amp;quot; The Washington Post also reported in 2009 that Murtha's nephew received $4 million in Defense Department no-bid contracts: &amp;quot;Newly obtained documents…show Robert Murtha mentioning his influential family connection as leverage in his business dealings and holding unusual power with the military.&amp;quot; 10. Rep. Charles Rangel (D-NY): Rangel, the man in charge of writing tax policy for the entire country, has yet to adequately explain how he could possibly &amp;quot;forget&amp;quot; to pay taxes on $75,000 in rental income he earned from his off-shore rental property. He also faces allegations that he improperly used his influence to maintain ownership of highly coveted rent-controlled apartments in Harlem, and misused his congressional office to fundraise for his private Rangel Center by preserving a tax loophole for an oil drilling company in exchange for funding. On top of all that, Rangel recently amended his financial disclosure reports, which doubled his reported wealth. (He somehow &amp;quot;forgot&amp;quot; about $1 million in assets.) And what did he do when the House Ethics Committee started looking into all of this? He apparently resorted to making &amp;quot;campaign contributions&amp;quot; to dig his way out of trouble. According to WCBS TV, a New York CBS affiliate: &amp;quot;The reigning member of Congress' top tax committee is apparently 'wrangling' other politicos to get him out of his own financial and tax troubles...Since ethics probes began last year the 79-year-old congressman has given campaign donations to 119 members of Congress, including three of the five Democrats on the House Ethics Committee who are charged with investigating him.&amp;quot; Charlie Rangel should not be allowed to remain in Congress, let alone serve as Chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, and he knows it. That's why he felt the need to disburse campaign contributions to Ethics Committee members and other congressional colleagues.

<photo  date_taken="2009-08-12 09:21:16" description="Or, as I prefer to think of it, my next home. What a little gem of a building! I'm so fond of it I spent a good 20 minutes removing a &amp;quot;No Parking&amp;quot; sign and its pole from the right side of the central door with Photo Shop. In the real world, it's still there. The building seems to be in pristine condition, right down to the metal shutters still hanging straight and true on wrought-iron hinges. If anything would have been messed with, it would have been the cornice, and I don't see any evidence of that. After studying the facade briefly, I'd say the pattern consists of cut stones of several different standard sizes arranged seemingly at random. And I'd still be saying that if I hadn't spent a considerable amount of time today analyzing the facade. It turns out the stones are laid in an attactive diagonal pattern that's practically invisible unless one spends a lot of time looking closely at the building. If you'd like to see the pattern, go forward a few photos and you'll find my colorized version of this image. Enjoy! The masons who built this wall must have used templates to ensure the stones were of uniform size. Surely, this sort of proficiency in cut stone must be a lost art or close to it in these United States, though some earnest and idealistic graduates of small, elite liberal arts colleges might take up this trade with gusto - to the utter horror of their parents or trustees, who paid ruinous tuition, fees, and room and board for years. This new generation of masons probably would have been exposed to the trade during their senior &amp;quot;independent project&amp;quot; spring term at their prep schools, unless they were drawn to such other useful gentlemanly pursuits as: a) building wooden boats; b) crafting post-and-beam houses in New England: c) teaching at-risk youth to make lacrosse sticks by hand; or d) developing a program for their family foundations to help middle-class kids accept that the cards are heavily stacked against them at both ends and to stop trying so damn hard. Their clients? Why, until recently, the crooks who were building mansions that aped pre-WWI estates in the most coveted precincts of enclaves such as Greenwich, Connecticut. But I digress . . . Note that an arch was built into the first two or three courses above ground level, just below the large door at the center of the building. I can think of two possible explanations for this, one of which is far more plausible than the other. The first interpretation is that the arch is the top of a doorway that was used when the original ground surface was much, much lower than it is today. If the ground surface is essentially unchanged since the building was built, then a ramp dug into the ground led to a lower level, and the arch is the top of an entrance to an earlier bottom floor that has since been buried. My second interpretation is the arch adds strength to the foundation courses where they might be expected to bear the most weight, namely at the building's threshold. I believe the second explanation is far more likely to be accurate than the first. The main problem with the first theory, which posits the arch is the top of a long-buried door to a buried lower level, is such a door would make the main entrance that we see today superfluous if not totally useless. There's no indication the central door was a later addition created by cutting into a solid wall. Also, if this building sits atop a buried lower story, so would the surrounding structures, and there would be signs everywhere for tours of &amp;quot;Underground Baker City&amp;quot; - which there aren't. On the other hand, stone arches can support considerable weight, and it would be prudent to take measures of some sort to prevent the foundation courses from sinking or breaking as heavy materials were moved in and out of the building. Anyway, anytime the Ryder Brothers find a new warehouse for their inventory, yours truly would be eager to evaluate the building for conversion to a residence.

The Miami Herald &amp;gt; Living &amp;gt; Travel &amp;gt; Travel Troubleshooter Posted on Friday, 12.28.12 THE TRAVEL TROUBLESHOOTER BY CHRISTOPHER ELLIOTT CHRISTOPHER@ELLIOTT.ORG &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/12/28/3155943/they-canceled-my-flight-why-do.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.miamiherald.com/2012/12/28/3155943/they-canceled-my-f...&lt;/a&gt; Q. We recently booked a one-way ticket from Los Angeles to San Francisco on Virgin America to get us home after our trip from Tahiti. But about a month later, our travel agent informed us that our return flight from Tahiti to Los Angeles had been canceled. I called Virgin America and was told that it would cost us $180 to change the flight to the next day, when our new flight was scheduled. There are more than four months between now and then to resell those two seats. If those four seats were not rebooked in the next four months, I would be OK with getting charged or losing my money. Virgin’s “guest services commitment” promises the airline is “constantly striving to give you the kind of Virgin America experience you came to us for in the first place.” I can’t believe that an airline is so steadfast in a policy that it can’t work with a customer. Vacationing is supposed to be relaxing and enjoyable and sometimes plans change, which I understand. What I don’t understand is that when things do change, why an organization like Virgin America has to make it stressful and inconvenient on their customer’s pocketbook. Bret Bickar Alameda, Calif. You’re right, there’s something fundamentally unfair about airline change fees. If an airline can resell the ticket, why should you have to pay for the change? But Virgin America is doing what other airlines also do, and have been doing for a long time, and I don’t have the room for the argument in this column. Here’s what struck me about your case: You used a travel agent to make your booking, and if you did, then your itinerary should have been connected. That means Virgin America should have known about your change and would have put you on the next flight at no cost to you. (Actually, that’s one of the reasons you use a travel agent; they can ensure your itineraries are connected, preventing you from being stuck in an airport with no way to get home.) Your travel agent should have told you that your Los Angeles to San Francisco flight was taken care of. When you called Virgin America, the representative you spoke with should have also seen that you were flying in from Tahiti. But somehow, these flights were not connected. This is a common problem with do-it-yourself travel agents. They buy several legs of a flight separately, assuming that they’ll be taken care of when something goes wrong. But they aren’t. You’re considered no-shows when the flight is delayed or canceled and are forced to pay for a new one-way ticket to reach your destination. I asked Virgin America to look into your itinerary. It refunded your change fee and allowed you to fly one day later at no extra cost. . . ............................................................................................................................................................................................ . .....item 2).... youtube video ...

I put it on just at 1O:3O in the morning, and it loosely follows the day (in the manner of &amp;quot;Days of Future Passed&amp;quot;). The temperament of the day and the band go well together, because Thanksgiving is a peculiar sort of holiday; not religious, but certainly both spiritual and emotionally significant. A wonderful day to enjoy with those you love. The music also includes all the outtakes from the seven albums of that period.

The reactor at the Pilgrim Nuclear Power Plant in Plymouth closed down with no problems and there was no threat to public safety, an official at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said. 'There was no impact on plant workers or the public,' he said. The snowstorm, which continued on Saturday, disrupted thousands of flights and left more than 200,000 people without power in Massachusetts alone. The wind-whipped snowstorm mercifully arrived at the start of a weekend, which meant fewer cars on the road and extra time for sanitation crews to clear the mess before commuters in the New York-to-Boston region of roughly 25 million people have to go back to work. But it also could mean a weekend cooped up indoors. Although most, if not all, drivers had been removed from the vehicles, the Long Island Expressway that stretches nearly 70 miles east from Manhattan's Queens-Midtown Tunnel to Suffolk County on outer edges of Long Island is expected to remain a challenge for emergency vehicles. ‘One hundred is a good estimate (of the number of cars abandoned),’ said Lt. Daniel Meyers, a spokesperson for the Suffolk County Highway Patrol. ‘We're waiting for the sun to come up so we can get a better count. ‘A lot of these cars have been buried under the snow. Right now, we're out looking for disabled motorists, and getting them to safe locations. We're pretty sure there are no drivers left anymore.’ Most of the vehicles became disabled, or stuck behind other disabled vehicles, simply because residents refused to heed warnings to stay off the roads. The disabled vehicles will impede the process of clearing the Expressway. It's very demanding on all the assets we have here,’ Meyers said. ‘The plows can't plow because of the disabled motorists, and the snow keeps piling up, piling up. It's a very daunting task.’ 'The wind is just pounding,' Jordana Fleischut told CNN from Nantucket, Massachusetts which previously saw the strongest wind gusts hitting at 69 mph. 'It's currently moving the Jeep that we're in -- that's how powerful it is.' Parts of New York and New Jersey are weathering 1-2 inches of snow per hour where in Manhattan's Central Park there's at least 8-inches seen. East in Upton, Long Island there's at least 22.5 inches reported on the ground and one foot reported in River Vale, New Jersey. In New England 2-3 inches is said to be falling in parts of New England where the highest snowfall of 26 inches is currently being reported in Hamden, Connecticut just before midnight on Friday.

New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg told residents to keep out of the streets and warned 'we've got to prepare for the worst case' as he spoke at a press conference from City Hall. 'Stay off the city streets, stay out of cars and stay in your homes,' he said, adding that tonight people should 'cook a meal, stay at home, read a good book, take it easy'. . ......................... img code photo ...

<photo  date_taken="2008-11-20 12:12:55" description="&amp;quot;Now what I get a sense of from all of this -- and then topped obviously by spending all the money in 2000 to basically buy the election -- is that this is not a family that has a particularly strong commitment to American democracy. “Its sense of how to win elections comes out of a CIA manual, not out of the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution.&amp;quot; &lt;i&gt; ~ Kevin Phillips&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;amp;id=Wty3o92hyigC&amp;amp;dq=&amp;quot;American+Dynasty&amp;quot;+&amp;quot;Kevin+Phillips&amp;quot;&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;ots=2GZLwvbTPW&amp;amp;sig=SNJTMxIHFk4RtiJWOumDVYOMaco&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;resnum=4&amp;amp;ct=result#PPA5,M1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;amp;id=Wty3o92hyigC&amp;amp;dq=&amp;...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.motherjones.com/arts/books/2004/01/12_103.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.motherjones.com/arts/books/2004/01/12_103.html&lt;/a&gt; Unlike the recent spate of anti-Bush books, Phillips' American Dynasty -- an erudite manifesto on the dangers of cronyism, hereditary privilege, &amp;quot;paper entrepreneurialism,&amp;quot; and tax shelters -- is devastating due to its analytical fair-mindedness. Essentially, he traces how four generations of Bushes corrupted U.S. foreign policy through international business ventures that benefited the family. The most recent two George Bushes aren't evil people, Phillips argues, just greedy and ambitious Ivy League Texans. The Bush family has brought the American political system to a &amp;quot;perilous state,&amp;quot; he believes, due to their cunning brand of petro-politics. . . . With great skill, Phillips illuminates how the &amp;quot;Bush Dynasty&amp;quot; has long used such old-boy organizations as Yale's Skull and Bones, the CIA, Dillon Read, and most recently the Carlyle Group to further its main objective: political-economic power. He delineates the family's ethically questionable dealings with such companies as Enron, Zapata Petroleum, and Halliburton. We even learn that Prescott Bush, George H.W.'s father and a U.S. senator from Connecticut, had investment dealings with Nazi Germany in the 1930s while working for the banking firm Brown Brothers Harriman. . . . It's the certitude of our current president's born-againism that disturbs Phillips the most. Somehow his descriptions of oil greed or CIA intrigue or Beltway manipulation are less alarmist than the long chapter devoted to Bush's evangelism. . . . Phillips does a credible job of connecting Protestant fundamentalism in Dixie with similar movements in the Middle East and East Asia. His exposé on the history of Armageddon as an influential concept in American foreign policy is simultaneously humorous and scary. . . . Phillips is a deep thinker extraordinaire, who does a masterful job of connecting the military-industrial dots right up to the conduct of the Iraq War and the postwar reconstruction. In American Dynasty, he has provided an informed, nigh-genetic basis for understanding our current president. &lt;i&gt;Douglas Brinkley is director of the Eisenhower Center for American Studies and professor of history at the University of New Orleans. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/American-Dynasty-Aristocracy-Fortune-Politics/dp/0670032646&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.amazon.com/American-Dynasty-Aristocracy-Fortune-Polit...&lt;/a&gt; Amazon.com Review Paraphrasing a passage from Machiavelli's The Prince, Kevin Phillips writes, &amp;quot;a ruler can ignore the mob and devote himself to the interests of the ruling class, gulling the inert majority who constitute the ruled.&amp;quot; He then says, &amp;quot;Borgia references aside, 21st-century American readers of The Prince may feel that they have stumbled on a thinly disguised Bush White House political memo.&amp;quot; These pointed words would sting regardless of who uttered them, but coming from Phillips, a former Republican strategist, they have an added piquancy. In American Dynasty: Aristocracy, Fortune, and the Politics of Deceit in the House of Bush, Phillips traces the rise of the Bush family from investment banking elites to political power brokers, using their Ivy League network, vast wealth, and questionable political maneuvering to obtain the White House and consequently, shake the foundation of constitutional American democracy. Citing the Bush family mainstays of finance, energy (oil), the military industrial complex, and national security and intelligence (the CIA), Phillips uses copious examples to show the dangerous alliance between the Bushes' business interests (huge corporations such as Enron and Haliburton) and the formation of national policy. No other family, Phillips says, that has fulfilled its presidential aspirations has been so involved in the ascendancy of the arms industry and of the 21st-century American imperium--often at the expense of regional and world peace and for their personal gain. It is hard to tell what offends Phillips the most: the Bushes' systematic deceit and secrecy, their shady business dealings, their cronyism, or their family philosophy that privileges the very wealthy and utterly dismisses all the rest. It is clearly all of these things combined. But at the top of Phillips' list is the dynastic nature of their family power, for it is that concentration of power and influence that strikes at the heart of our democracy. Past administrations have transgressed, albeit not so egregiously, and other political families have had dynastic ambitions. But none have succeeded as thoroughly as the Bushes. Jefferson and Madison would be horrified, and according to Phillips, we should be too. --&lt;i&gt; ~ Silvana Tropea&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buzzflash.com/interviews/04/01/int04001.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.buzzflash.com/interviews/04/01/int04001.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Phillips_(political_commentator)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Phillips_(political_commentator)&lt;/a&gt; Succeeding in Business &lt;a href=&quot;http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E5DD1E31F934A35754C0A9649C8B63&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E5DD1E31F934A...&lt;/a&gt; As Joshua Green says in The Washington Monthly, in a must-read article written just before the administration suddenly became such an exponent of corporate ethics: ''The 'new tone' that George W. Bush brought to Washington isn't one of integrity, but of permissiveness. . . . In this administration, enriching oneself while one's business goes bust isn't necessarily frowned upon.''" id="3051933363" latitude="0" license="3" longitude="0" nbComments="1" rank="52" tags="november2008 book kevinphillips george bush family repbulican oil politics cia democracy war" title="American Dynasty: Aristocracy, Fortune, and the Politics of Deceit in the House of Bush - by Kevin Phillips" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/3178/3051933363_17314f83e2_b.jpg" username="elycefeliz" views="961" />

<photo  date_taken="2010-02-16 16:26:34" description="Cissy Patterson home at Dupont Circle Eleanor Medill &amp;quot;Cissy&amp;quot; Patterson (November 7, 1881 - July 24, 1948) was an American journalist and newspaper editor, publisher and owner. Patterson was one of the first women to head a major daily newspaper, the Washington Times-Herald in Washington, D.C.. Elinor Josephine Patterson was born in Chicago, Illinois, the daughter of Robert and Nellie (Medill) Patterson. She would change the spelling of her first name to &amp;quot;Eleanor&amp;quot; as an adult, but would always be known as &amp;quot;Cissy,&amp;quot; the name her brother gave her in childhood. Her grandfather Joseph Medill was Mayor of Chicago and owned the Chicago Tribune, which later passed into the hands of her first cousin Colonel Robert R. McCormick, Joseph Medill's grandson. Her older brother Joseph Medill Patterson was the founder of the New York Daily News. She was educated at Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Connecticut. When her uncle Robert S. McCormick was named ambassador to Austria-Hungary, she accompanied him and his wife, Cissy's maternal aunt Kate, to Vienna. There she met Count Josef Gizycki and fell in love with him, a romance not interrupted even by her return to America, where she lived in Washington, D.C.. In Washington, she was a leading light in society, where the press labeled Alice Roosevelt (daughter of Theodore), Marguerite Cassini (daughter of the Russian ambassador), and Cissy the &amp;quot;Three Graces.&amp;quot; Count Gizycki came to America and they were married in Washington on April 14, 1904 despite the objections of her family, which later proved well-founded. A daughter was born to them September 3, 1905, and was named Leonora Felicia. Cissy went with the Count to his home, a huge feudal manor in Russia. Their family life did not go well, but when Cissy wanted to leave, he tried to keep her there. She fled with their child, hiding her in a house near London, but the Count pursued her and kidnapped the little Countess, hiding her in an Austrian convent while demanding a million dollars in ransom. Cissy filed for divorce, which took thirteen years to obtain, and in which William Howard Taft and Czar Nicholas II were personally involved. The Czar ordered the Count to return the child to her mother. After her experience abroad, she moved to Lake Forest, Illinois, a Chicago suburb, but she returned to Washington in 1913. In 1920, her brother Joseph finally succumbed to his sister's entreaties and allowed her to write for his New York Daily News, founded the previous year. She also worked for William Randolph Hearst. She published two novels, romans a clef, Glass Houses (1926) and Fall Flight (1928), part of her feud with former friend Alice Roosevelt Longworth. Patterson tried to buy the Washington Herald and the Washington Times, then separate papers, from Hearst, who hated to sell anything, even when he needed the money. Although he had never made money from his Washington papers, he refused. However, at the urging of his editor Arthur Brisbane, Hearst agreed to make Patterson editor of the Herald. She began work on August 1, 1930. Patterson was a hands-on editor who insisted on the best of everything--writing, layout, typographic, graphics, comics, everything. She encouraged society reporting and the women's page and hired many women as reporters. In 1936, she was invited to join the all-male American Society of Newspaper Editors. Patterson made her paper popular with all strata of Washington society and doubled its circulation. In 1937, Hearst's finances had gotten worse and he agreed to lease the Herald and the Times to Patterson with an option to buy. Eugene Meyer, the man who had outbid Hearst and Patterson for The Washington Post in 1933, tried to buy the Herald out from under Patterson, but failed. Instead, she bought both papers from Hearst on January 28, 1939, and merged them as the Times-Herald. Along with her brother at the New York Daily News and her cousin at the Chicago Tribune, Patterson was an ardent isolationist and opponent of the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1942, after the Battle of Midway, the Times-Herald ran a Tribune story that revealed American intelligence was reading the Japanese naval code. Roosevelt, furious, had the Tribune and the Times-Herald indicted for espionage but backed down because of the publicity, charges he was persecuting his enemies, and the likelihood of an acquittal (since the Navy's own censors had twice cleared the story before it was published). During World War II, she and her brother were accused by their enemies of being Nazi sympathizers. Representative Elmer Holland of Pennsylvania on the floor of the United States House of Representatives said Cissy and Joseph Patterson &amp;quot;would welcome the victory of Hitler.&amp;quot; She feuded with her daughter, who publicly &amp;quot;divorced&amp;quot; her in 1945, and with her former son-in-law, Drew Pearson . Alienated from her family and friends, she turned to alcohol, and died alone at her home Dower House near Marlboro, Maryland. She left the paper to seven of her editors who within the year sold the paper to her cousin Colonel McCormick. He held onto the paper for five years, and despite being on the verge of profitability once more, he sold out to the Post, which promptly closed the paper. On a lighter note, as Countess Gyzicki, Patterson was a frequent visitor to Jackson Hole, Wyoming in the 1920s where Donald Hough records an unexpected aspect of her personality: the ability to speak effectively to horses in language worthy of a native cowboy. ---Ms. Patterson was one of the &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; girls during the Gilded Age's/early 1900's society in Washington, she delighted in stirring up trouble whenever and whereever she could. She was also a good friend of Alice Longworth Roosevelt who lived in the 2200 block of P St. just a short distance away until a feud broke up their friendship FYI: Alice Longworth Roosevelt was the one who made the phrase &amp;quot;if you don't have anything nice to say, come sit by me&amp;quot; famous. ---Charles A Linburgh stayed at the Patterson home on the circle and made an hero’s appearance to thousands after his historic solo flight to Paris from the 2nd floor balcony to people gathered in Dupont Circle ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- One such grand residence is the marble and terra-cotta Patterson house at 15 Dupont Circle (currently the Washington Club). This superb Italianate mansion, the only survivor of the many mansions that once ringed the circle itself, was built in 1901 by New York architect Stanford White for Robert Patterson, editor of the Chicago Tribune, and his wife Nellie Patterson, heiress to the Chicago Tribune fortune. Upon Mrs. Patterson's incapacitation in the early 1920s, the house passed into the hands of her daughter, Cissy Patterson, who made it a hub of Washington social life. The house served as temporary quarters for President and Mrs. Calvin Coolidge in 1927 while the White House underwent renovation. The Coolidges welcomed Charles Lindbergh as a houseguest after his historic transatlantic flight. Lindbergh made several public appearances at the house, waving to roaring crowds from the second-story balcony, and befriended the Patterson Family, with whom he increasingly came to share isolationist and pro-German views. Cissy Patterson later acquired the Washington Times-Herald (acquired by the Washington Post in 1954) and declared journalistic warfare on Franklin Delano Roosevelt, from 15 Dupont Circle, continuing throughout World War II to push her policies, which were echoed in the New York Daily News, run by her brother Joseph Medill Patterson, and the Chicago Tribune, run by their first cousin, Colonel Robert R. McCormick." id="83259516" latitude="0" license="4" longitude="0" nbComments="5" rank="54" tags="" title="Cissy Patterson" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/42/83259516_522636b6a6_b.jpg" username="dbking" views="7617" />

The site was scouted as early as 1926, but construction didn't begin until 1840 and was completed in 1851, at a cost of over $2 million. Dry docks are great chambers below water level used for the repair and construction of ships. A ship can be brought in from the adjoining body of water once the chamber has been filled with water. The chamber is then drained, allowing the ship to rest on wooden blocks so that work may proceed. After work is completed, the chamber is flooded to outside water level, the gate is opened, and the ship can depart. The 344-foot long, 50-foot wide, 21-foot deep dock is fashioned entirely from massive, hand-cut and hand-sanded blocks of granite excavated from a quarries in Maine, Connecticut, Staten Island and upstate New York. Still served by its original pumps, though now powered by electricity, it is the smallest dry dock at the navy yard today, mainly used for tugboats. The Brooklyn Navy Yard, also known as the New York Naval Shipyard (NYNSY), is located in Wallabout Basin, a semicircular bend of the East River. The waterfront site was used to build merchant vessels following the American Revolution. Federal authorities purchased the old docks and 40 acres of land in 1801, and it became an active US Navy shipyard in 1906. By the American Civil War, the yard had expanded to employ about 6000 men. In 1890, the ill-fated Maine was launched from the Yard's ways. On the eve of World War II, the yard contained more than five miles of paved streets, four drydocks, two steel shipways, and six pontoons and cylindrical floats for salvage work, barracks for marines, a power plant, a large radio station, and a railroad spur, as well as the expected foundries, machine shops, and warehouses. In 1937 the battleship North Carolina was laid down.

At its peak, during World War II, the yard employed 70,000 people, 24 hours a day. The Navy decommissioned the yard in 1966 and sold it to the City of New York.

The waterfront site was used to build merchant vessels following the American Revolution. Federal authorities purchased the old docks and 40 acres of land in 1801, and it became an active US Navy shipyard in 1906. By the American Civil War, the yard had expanded to employ about 6000 men. In 1890, the ill-fated Maine was launched from the Yard's ways. On the eve of World War II, the yard contained more than five miles of paved streets, four drydocks, two steel shipways, and six pontoons and cylindrical floats for salvage work, barracks for marines, a power plant, a large radio station, and a railroad spur, as well as the expected foundries, machine shops, and warehouses. In 1937 the battleship North Carolina was laid down. The battleship Iowa was completed in 1942 followed by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/4795387768/&quot;&gt;USS Missouri (BB-63)&lt;/a&gt; and then in 1952, Antietam. At its peak, during World War II, the yard employed 70,000 people, 24 hours a day. The Navy decommissioned the yard in 1966 and sold it to the City of New York. A few decades later, it became an area of private manufacturing and commercial activity. It now has over 200 tenants with more than 3,500 employees, and is managed and operated by the Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation for the City of New York Open House New York weekend, America's largest architect and design event, opens doors throughout New York City each October.

He proceeded at once in the business of the hour in preparing a place for the reception of his family which came out the next year. Having shipped a sawmill from the east, he hauled it down from Lawrence, the nearest railroad point, and located it on the Neosho river where it was known as the Baldwin &amp;amp; Butler mill and was operated for two years, sawing lumber for the settlers and for Mr. Butler's own residence which was built in 1871. At this time he also laid out his grounds about the residence which include about three acres, with circular drive, now fringed with evergreen and shade trees down to the public highway.

The occupants said they were about to move out so the Achesons bought it and only stepped inside after the others left. ---Acheson gave a farewell party lunch party here on the Harry Truman's last day in office.

Truman. In these various capacities he played a central role in the creation of many important institutions including Lend Lease, the Marshall Plan, the United Nations, NATO, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, together with the early organizations that later became the European Union and the World Trade Organization. He presided over United States diplomacy during several important crises of the early Cold War, including the Korean War. Acheson's career also was marked by controversy. Although he developed anti-Communist views early in his political career, Acheson was a prominent defender of State Department employees accused during Senator Joseph McCarthy's anti-Communist investigations. Acheson was also instrumental in the prehistory of the Vietnam War, having persuaded Truman to dispatch aid to French forces in Indochina, but later counseled President Lyndon B. Johnson to negotiate for peace with North Vietnam. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, President John F. Kennedy called upon Acheson for advice, bringing him into Kennedy's executive committee (ExComm). Early Life and Career Dean Acheson was born in Middletown, Connecticut. His father, Edward Campion Acheson, was an English-born Church of England priest who, after several years in Canada, moved to the US to become Episcopal Bishop of Connecticut. His mother, Eleanor Gertrude Gooderham, was a granddaughter of prominent Canadian distiller, William Gooderham (1790-1881), founder of the Gooderham and Worts Distillery. Acheson's primary schooling was at Groton School, at which Acheson did not enjoy, nor did he perform very well, scoring largely average marks during his time there. Later Acheson was educated at Yale University (1912-15), where he became a member of the prestigious secret society, Scroll and Key. It was not until Acheson entered Harvard Law School, where he attended from (1915-18) that the future Secretary of State became studious. At the latter he became a protege of the professor Felix Frankfurter, who taught Administrative Law Courses at the Law School. Acheson also attended law school with future luminaries such as John J. McCloy who got him a job in Washington. At that time, a new tradition of bright law students clerking for the U.S. Supreme Court had been begun by Supreme Court Justice, Louis Brandeis for whom Acheson clerked for two terms from(1919-21). Frankfurter and Brandeis were close associates, and future Supreme Court Justice Frankfurter suggested that Brandeis take on Acheson. [edit] Economic Diplomacy A supporter of the United States Democratic Party, Acheson worked at a law firm in Washington D.C., Covington &amp;amp; Burling, often dealing with international legal issues before Franklin Delano Roosevelt appointed him as Undersecretary of the United States Treasury in 1933. Acheson did not stay in this post long, as he and President Roosevelt found themselves at loggerheads over FDR's plans of changing the price of gold. Much of this Acheson recounted in his book, &amp;quot;Morning and Noon.&amp;quot; Later, FDR would bring Acheson back into his administration, placing Acheson in the State Department. There Acheson developed much of the economic warfare waged by the United States against the Axis Powers prior to its formal entry into World War II, including the embargos that led to the 1940 diplomatic crisis with Japan and its subsequent 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. In 1944, Acheson attended the Bretton Woods Conference in New Hampshire as the head delegate from the State Department. At this conference the post-war international economic structure was designed. This conference was the birthplace of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the last of which would evolve into the World Trade Organization. [edit] Cold War Diplomacy Later, in 1945, Harry S. Truman selected Acheson as his Undersecretary of United States Department of State, working under Secretaries of State Stettinius, Byrnes, and Marshall. Often during the post-war period, the Secretary was overseas, and Acheson was the acting Secretary attending Cabinet meetings. During this period, Acheson cemented a very close relationship with President Truman. Over the next two years, Acheson played an important role in devising both the Truman Doctrine and the European Recovery Program. Acheson believed that the best way to halt the spread of communism was by helping rebuild a functioning economic structure in Western Europe. In 1949, Acheson was appointed Secretary of State. In this position he built a working framework to the policy of the containment, first formulated by George Kennan, who served as the head of Acheson's Policy Planning Staff. Acheson played instrumental part in the formation of NATO, and is the signer to the pact for the United States. The formation of NATO was a great departure from established U.S. foreign policy, in which the United States would refrain from 'entangling alliances.' [edit] &amp;quot;The Attack of the Primitives&amp;quot; The failure of the United States to prevent the communist takeover of mainland China in 1949 precipitated several years of organized opposition to Acheson's tenure, a period to which Acheson refers in his outspoken memoirs as &amp;quot;The Attack of the Primitives.&amp;quot; Although he maintained his role as a firm anti-communist, he was attacked by various anti-communists for not taking a more active role in attacking communism abroad and domestically, rather than a mere containment of communist governments. Both he and Secretary of Defense George Marshall came under attack from men such as Joseph McCarthy; Acheson became a byword to some Americans, who tried to equate containment with appeasement. Richard Nixon, who later as President would call on Acheson for advice, would complain of &amp;quot;Acheson's College of Cowardly Communist Containment.&amp;quot; This criticism grew very loud after Acheson refused to 'turn his back on Alger Hiss' when the latter was accused of being a Communist Spy, which was later proved by the Venona Project. On December 15, 1950, the Republicans in the House of Representatives resolved unanimously that he be removed from office, to no avail. Furthermore, Acheson also upset the right wing when he took the side of Harry S. Truman in his dispute with General Douglas MacArthur over the Korean War. Acheson and Truman wanted to limit the war to Korea, whereas MacArthur called for the extension of the war to China. Return to Private Life After the 1952 presidential campaign, Acheson returned to his private law practice. Although his official governmental career was over, his influence was not. Acheson headed up Democratic Policy Groups during the Eisenhower years. Much of President Kennedy's flexible response policies came from the position papers drawn up by this group. Acheson's law offices were strategically located across Lafayette Park from the White House and he accomplished much out of office. He became an unofficial advisor to the Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon administrations. In 1964, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In 1970, he won the Pulitzer Prize for History for his memoirs of his tenure in the State Department, Present at the Creation: My Years in the State Department. In 1971, Dean Acheson died of a massive stroke at his desk on his farm in Sandy Spring, Maryland at the age of 78." id="215370699" latitude="0" license="4" longitude="0" nbComments="0" rank="61" tags="" title="Dean Acheson" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/73/215370699_5142c0e193_b.jpg" username="dbking" views="8226" />
<photo  date_taken="2012-04-11 08:27:15" description="Company H, 4th Iowa Cavalry A Standard History of Kansas and Kansans, written &amp;amp; compiled by William E. Connelley, 1918 Thomas Newell Robb, father of William E., was born near Elkhart, Indiana, December 29, 1830. The date of his birth fixes the fact that the Robb family were among the very earliest settlers in that part of Northern Indiana. Thomas Newell Robb married Caroline Isabell Carrick, a widow whose maiden name was Stevenson. Her father was Chester Stevenson, and her grandfather had served with the Connecticut troops at Yorktown where Lord Cornwallis surrendered and brought to a close the Revolutionary war. An interesting account of this concluding scene of the Revolution has been preserved in the family annals. The Americans were drawn up in line on one side, with the French under Lafayette on the other, and in the lane or alley between the two lines the British soldiers marched with Lord Cornwallis at their head to the point where they stacked their arms. Chester Stevenson had three brothers who were also soldiers in the War of 1812 and were present at the battle of Niagara where the Americans surrendered to the British and the Indians. The American soldiers were drawn up in line, and were counted off by twos. Thus there were formed two columns. When all were enumerated the English took one column as their share of the prisoners, while the Indians took the other column. The prisoners who fell to the mercy of the Indians were immediately tomahawked and killed. The English paid the Indians $8 for each scalp torn from the head of an American prisoner. As a result of this grim lottery two of the three brothers of Chester Stevenson met death as being in the line of prisoners turned over to the Indians. Chester Stevenson had four sons and five daughters: David, William, Simon, Lewis, Caroline, Mary, Lucy, Maria, and Almira. When Thomas Newell Robb was six years old, in 1836, his parents, Scott and Lavina Robb, left Northern Indiana and moved to Durand, Winnebago County, Illinois. They went around the southern bend of Lake Michigan and passed through what was then the small Village of Chicago. At Rockford, Illinois, they crossed the Rock River. They experienced considerable trouble in getting their stock over the stream at the ford, and one hog was drowned in crossing, though they finally got the rest of the cattle and hogs over safely. Thomas N. Robb lived at Durand, Illinois, with his father, Scott Robb, until the latter's death on November 13, 1846. Thomas N. was then sixteen years of age. In 1852 he left Durand and went west for the purpose of locating a land warrant owned by his mother and granted because of Scott Robb's services in the War of 1812. With this warrant he proceeded to Chickasaw County, Iowa, and in Deerfield Township laid claim to 160 acres of land. His military land warrant was numbered 6215, and the title to the land was given in the name of Lavina Robb, his mother. This land was the southeast quarter of section 5 in township 96 north, range 14 west. The land office was at Dubuque, Iowa. He reached the land office October 22, 1852. On the morning of that day when he entered the office he found men lined up waiting their turn, and when the office was opened for business one of the number stepped forward and said he would take all the vacant land left in Howard and Chickasaw counties. This statement produced consternation, and for a time, it looked as if the other men seeking claims would have all their trouble for nothing. Then ensued considerable talk among the men and the land officials, and it was finally decided to allow each man to settle on the claim he had picked out for a home. Thus Thomas N. Robb became the possessor of 160 acres. After getting title to the land he returned to Durand, Illinois, and the next summer, on July 3, 1853, he married Caroline Isabell Carrick. In the spring of 1855 they moved to Chickasaw County, Iowa, to the new home where he put up a log house about 18 by 22 feet. The land was covered by timber and hazel brush, and the family occupied the old log house about twelve years until it was replaced with a frame dwelling. To the marriage of Thomas N. Robb and Caroline Isabell Carrick were born five children, three sons and two daughters. The oldest of these is William Eugene Robb, reference to whose career may be reserved for a later paragraph. The second was a daughter, Calistia Lavina Robb, who was born January 18, 1856, at Deerfield, Iowa. She was well educated, taught two terms of school in Iowa, and at the age of fourteen returned to Illinois to live with her grandmother, Lavina Robb, and her aunt, Calistia Harris. He was married December 23, 1875, to John Jay Cleveland, who died in 1905. She died in 1906. The third of the children was a daughter, Rosalia Melissa Robb, who was born June 13, 1857, at Deerfield in Chickasaw County, Iowa. She lived there and taught several terms of school until the fall of 1875, when she came with her parents to Neal, Greenwood County, Kansas. She taught several years in Kansas, and on February 21, 1883, married Nelson Elhanen Turney. They lived at or near Neal until the Cherokee strip was opened in the fall of 1893. Mr. Turney made the run and secured 160 acres near Enid, Oklahoma, about five miles from Hunter. He still owns that land, but he and his wife now live in their home at Wichita, Kansas. The next child of the family was a son, Walter Montville Robb, born May 3, 1861, at Chickasaw, Iowa. He lived in that locality until the fall of 1875, when he came with his parents to Greenwood County, Kansas, and helped in the work of the home until 1891. In that year he entered the Northwestern College at Des Moines, Iowa, spending two years there and also attended Oldbergs University at Chicago in 1894. After graduating he was given a druggist's diploma. April 17, 1895, he married Lilly Almira Christian of Plymouth, Worth County, Iowa. He now lives on his farm three-quarters of a mile east of Neal, in Greenwood County. The next child, also a son, was Harry Elmer Robb, born at Deerfield, Iowa, January 1, 1867. He was eight years of age when he came to Kansas with his parents in October, 1875, and lived at home in Greenwood County until 1888. In that year he entered the State Agricultural College at Manhattan, spending four years, and graduating. After his return home he was elected county surveyor in 1892 for the four-year term. August 5, 1896, he married Olive Robbins of Eureka, Kansas. They now live at Millertown, Oklahoma, where he owns property and in the county has eight log and lumber yards. The family had many interesting experiences in their pioneer life in Chickasaw County, Iowa. The first winter Thomas Newell Robb moved to Iowa the snow was deep, the winter was a hard and cold one, and during the winter he killed twenty-five deer. Deer were very numerous through the woods, and on some mornings when the family would get up and throw hay to the cattle, the deer would come out of the woods and eat along with the domestic animals. But immediately the door of the house was opened the deer would be gone. The following spring the snow began melting about March 20th, and then for six weeks there was almost continuous mud and slush before the weather settled down to agreeable conditions. Near the Robb home was the Wapsiepinicon River. Great quantities of fish would come up the stream every spring. Fish traps or dams were made, and by these means it was possible to secure tubfuls of suckers, redhorse, bass and pickerel. At times the family would see a wagonload of fish, caught in the lakes north and west, going by the house. The minnows were the chub and shiner, horned ace, punkin seeds and bull trout, as they called them. The pickerel and bass were the game fish, were caught with a hook, and made a great deal of sport. Then there were prairie chickens, partridges or pheasants, which would drum on the logs and make sounds like distant thunder, quails and wild pigeons. The wild pigeons roosted in the woods and built their nests in great numbers. When the young squabs reached considerable size the limbs would often bend under the weight and break and the young ones would fall to the ground. William E. Robb says he has seen flocks of wild pigeons in the spring flying north in an unbroken stream reaching from horizon to horizon and requiring thirty minutes to pass overhead. There were countless thousands in such flocks. The wild geese and ducks, brants and sandhill cranes would fly north in the spring and south in the fall, and they also seemed to number millions. Hundreds of them would light on the ponds and the Wapsiepinicon River. Squirrels, both gray and red, were also plentiful. Along the Wapsiepinicon grew large patches of wild plums, both red and yellow, wild crab apples, red haws and black haws, and thornapples. More wild fruit would ripen than all the neighbors could gather and use, and much of it would rot or spoil on the ground. The Wapsiepinicon made a bend to the east about a quarter of a mile from the northeast corner of the Robb farm, circled around and came west again about three-quarters of a mile south. At the latter point was built a bridge. Leading up to the bridge was a long turnpike with nine sluices or culverts. This was known over all the country around as the Wapsie bridge, and was one of the first bridges put up in that section of Iowa. North of the bridge was a low smooth piece of land called bottoms or sloughs. Grass grew on it very tall, and was burned off every fall. In 1850, two or three years before the Robb family located there, a battle had occurred on this flat land between two bands of Indians, the Sioux and the Winnebagos. The bodies of the slain were left lying on the battlefield, and afterwards the Robb children and many older people would go over the ground after it had been burned off and would gather up the beads, tomahawks, arrow points and sometimes a gun barrel was found. The Sioux Indians had been up to Fort Atkinson to draw their blankets and supplies, and on coming back had met the Winnebagos. The latter did not want the Sioux Indians to pass their camp, where they had left their old men, squaws and papooses. They bargained with the Sioux, giving them some blankets and ponies, if the Sioux would agree not to pass the camp. The Sioux proved traitorous to their agreement, and going to the camp along the Wapsiepinicon they killed most of the Indians found there. The Winnebago warriors returned too late, but followed the Sioux west and had a running fight with them. The Robb children would find bones and skulls near hazelbrush patches at intervals all the way across the country to the Little Cedar River, six miles west of the camp on the Wapsiepinicon. At the north end the battleground was a ford with a narrow trail called the cattle ford, and about midway was the old ford. At the south end was the bridge. Each place had a road, and these roads were known as the Cattle Ford Road, the Old Ford Road, the Bridge Road, the Culvert Road and the Wood Road. A fringe of timber grow along the banks of the Wapsiepinicon of soft maple, ash, willow and basswood. One of the early improvements in the community was the erection of a schoolhouse on the Thomas N. Robb land in 1858. The children of the family attended school there. In July, 1861, Thomas N. Robb enrolled in Company H of the Fourth Iowa Cavalry. On October 25 he was mustered into the United States service, and about November 1, 1861, was made a corporal. He was ward master through almost the entire period of his service with the regiment, and also hospital steward and nurse part of the time. His captain was Dewitt C. Crawford and his first lieutenant was Edwin A. Haskell. On December 21, 1863, he was discharge and veteranized on December 25, 1863, Christmas day. The regiment was mustered in as a veteran regiment and enlisted for three years more or during the war. The captain then was Samuel S. Troy. The engagements and skirmishes in which Thomas N. Robb had a part were: Little Red River or Brown's Ford June 3, 1862; Jones Lane or Lick Creek, October 11, 1862; Marianna, November 8, 1862; the campaign against Vicksburg, May 1 to July 4, 1863; Grenada raid August 10 to 25, 1863; from Vicksburg to Memphis; Baker's raid February 4, 1864, to June 11, Price's raid, including the battle of Independence October 22, 1864, the Big Blue October 23, 1864, Big Blue Prairie October 23, 1864, the Trading Post, October 25, 1864, Marias des Cygnes or Osage and Mine Creek, October 25, 1864; Charlotte Prairie, also called Marmaton, October 25, 1864. The last campaign of the war was Jackson, Canton, Tuscaloosa, Champion Hill, Helena, Selma and Pike's Ferry, April 8, 1865; Columbus, April 16, 1865; and Macon, Georgia. Thomas Robb was discharged at Atlanta, Georgia, August 8, 1865, and mustered out August 24, 1865, at Davenport, Iowa. After the war he returned to his home and resumed farming. In the meantime the country had been much improved. It was nearly all fenced and divided up into farms, and no Indians were seen in that part of Iowa after 1865. However, the cold winters were a great objection to residence there, and every such season Thomas N. Robb suffered more or less with pneumonia, or diphtheria. Having spent about four years in the warmer climates of the South while he was a soldier he thought that a more southerly residence would be greatly beneficial to his health, He then decided to try Kansas. In November, 1874, Thomas N. Robb came to Greenwood County, near where Neal now stands, and spent the winter. He liked the country so well that after considerable prospecting and investigation he bought 160 acres in section 33, township 25, range 12 east. In the summer of 1875 he returned to Iowa, sold his farm, and in October had a sale of his personal property. He then immediately started for Kansas with his family, consisting of wife, three sons and one daughter. He brought three teams and three covered wagons, and two loose colts. The family arrived in Greenwood County about the end of October. The land he had bought was unimproved, and it was impossible to rent a house in which to spend the winter. Under those conditions the two women in the family lived with W. E. Harris, who had a small rock house, while Mr. Robb and the boys lived in a wagon backed up against a hay stack. In that way they got along through November, and about the first of December they had finished the frame house 16 by 24 feet and 12 feet high. The frame had been hewed out of logs with a broadax, and William Hurd was employed to do the carpenter work. Thomas N. Robb afterwards built a stone house at a cost of $1,000. He kept two teams busy hauling stone for two years. For two weeks after coming to Kansas he looked around for a milch cow, but found none. Finally he had a chance to trade a team of horses and a wagon and harness to Kye Hobbs for fifteen cows and heifers. Mr. Hobbs was selling in order to move back to Indiana. These cows and heifers gave Mr. Robb his start as a cattle man. By keeping the increase he soon had 100 head of cattle, and in those years there was almost an unlimited supply of grass for hay and pasture. The winter after the family arrived they cut and hauled forty cords of four-foot wood to Eureka, selling it at $4 a cord. Money was extremely scarce and there was no opportunity to secure work. A. Kerr was hiring hands at $16 a month, but at the time he had all the help he needed. Thus Mr. Robb and the boys turned their labor to the task of making rails, and during the first winter they made enough to fence the 160 acres and they also built some stone wall. In the spring of 1876 they broke forty acres of land and planted twenty acres to sod corn. The planting was done by chopping a hole in each sod with an axe, and from this plnating they secured a crop of 400 bushels of big yellow ears. After the corn had grown up and practically matured the grasshoppers came in great numbers about the first of September, ate off all the leaves and husks, but left exposed the yellow ears, and these golden ears of corn could be seen at a considerable distance away. In the early days of the family's settlement in Greenwood County, the Indians, the Sac and Fox and the Caws would go North in the spring and South in the fall, sometimes camping for a week at a time. After the Missouri Pacific Railroad was built through in 1882, crossing the county from east to west, the country was rapidly developed and fenced and the Indians no longer passed this way. When the railroad was surveyed the county was thrown into a fever of excitement. The original survey was through Yates Center, Greenwood City and to Eureka. The original name of the railroad was the Fort Scott, Wichita &amp;amp; Western. The company wanted $10,000 in bonds in return for putting the road through from Yates Center through Greenwood City to Eureka. An election was called, but the bond proposition failed to carry in the Township of Pleasant Grove. Col. John Foley then proposed to divide the township, calling the north part Quincy and the south part Pleasant Grove Township. This was done, but it did not help the situation, since at the second election the bond issue again failed to carry. About that time the Town of Toronto agreed to give the railway company $28,000 in bonds if the road would be built five miles south and through Toronto. The railway accepted these terms, the road was built through Toronto, and Greenwood City, being left isolated, soon ceased to be a village. Not long afterward a railroad was built north and south along the Verdigris River, crossing the first road at Toronto. These two roads made a good-sized town there. Thomas Newell Robb kept his residence on the old farm until his wife died on May 15, 1889. In a couple of years he rented the farm and then made three trips to Seattle, Washington, and one to Southern Oklahoma to visit his son, Harry, also to Mena, Arkansas, and another trip to Hot Springs, Arkansas. When he was a young man he spent two winters in the pineries of Wisconsin and Michigan, and one summer fishing on a vessel in Lake Michigan. He made trips from Green Bay to Grand Traverse Bay, the Manitou Islands, Sturgeon Bay and made a trip to Duluth, visiting the pictured rocks along the shores of Lake Superior. He had been in thirty-one states of the Union. During the War of 1861 he was with Sherman on the famous march to the sea and went to Pensacola, Florida. On going out to Seattle, Washington, he made the trip one time along the Santa Fe to Southern California, and came back through Vancouver, British Columbia, then to Winnipeg, and south to Kansas. He used to say that he had been across the United States north and south and would like to go across it east and west. While in Washington he bought forty acres of land and tried farming, but soon gave it up and returned to Neal, Kansas, where he lived until his death, which occurred September 15, 1907. He was a republican in politics, served on the local school board, and was long an active member of the Grand Army of the Republic." id="7068969125" latitude="37.809004" license="6" longitude="-96.051836" nbComments="2" rank="62" tags="civilwarveteran tombstonephoto hobby thomasnewellrobb companyh4thiowacavalry iowa union biography" title="Thomas Newell Robb" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/5449/7068969125_2c5ce674b6_b.jpg" username="jajacks62" views="724" />
<photo  date_taken="2007-04-01 11:45:19" description="Henry Wadsworth Longfellow Monument When this staute was unveiled on M and Connecticut Streets NW, the place was absolutely buzzing. The heroic bronze figure sat draped in his academic robe, book in hand, and looked out on the streets packed with the wide spectrum of adoring fans: men, women, and children “of all races and nationalities.” It was May 7, 1909. The Marine Band played &amp;quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;America the Beautiful&amp;quot; while the flag that had previously covered the statue “floated above the heads of the great throng.” Then a Reverend blessed the ceremony—such was the power of the man! And yet for all the pomp with which it was dedicated, when DCist went to see this monument of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow one recent evening, we could hardly see him. The man described as “the joyful, enthusiastic mouthpiece of what was best in his time” sits unlit, alone, and stranded on an island in the middle of the noisy intersection southeast of Dupont Circle. Rev. George R. Grose wrote in the Zion’s Herald that at the dedication there was a large shield in the middle of the platform which read (from Longfellow’s “The Building of a Ship”): “Thou, too, sail on, O Ship of State! Sail on, O Union, strong and great! Humanity, with all its fears, With all the hopes of future years, Is hanging breathless on thy fate!” The only inscription we could find was one word: LONGFELLOW. Even though interest in the monument has obviously waned considerably—our contact at the NPS said, “In my six years here, no on has ever asked about the monument”—the original context of the monument’s construction is, as the Revisiting Series tends to find with most forgotten monuments, rather fascinating. The monument was erected not only as a testament to one of this country’s greatest poets, but also as a statement of American culture. For at the time of the unveiling, according to Grose, there were no national monuments in D.C. that commemorated American literature. Grose mentions the Poets’ Corner in Westminster Abbey, and is both relieved and jubilant that the nation was able to raise the $35,000—“by gifts from rich and poor”—to celebrate Longfellow’s contribution to American literature and society. Grose was sure the monument cemented the U.S.’s legitimacy in global culture and expressed the nation’s propulsion into a new age. Indeed, Longfellow, “while he makes us feel the nobility of his white soul, and brings close to our view the great, simple, normal life of humanity,” would be a fine model for America as it sought to keep its morals and traditions in order while adjusting to a frenetically industrialized, internationalizing modernity. There may not be “flags, wreaths, and festoons of laurel and bunches of iris, the poet’s favorite flower,” commemorating Longfellow anymore, but surely we have space in our hearts for a little appreciation for one of the most important figures in American literature. So next time you find yourself stuck in traffic or transitioning from one Dupont bar to another, take a second to pay your respects. Remember peaceful old Longfellow, the poet who was not only &amp;quot;the purest democrat known to humanity,&amp;quot; but a crucial player in this country's cultural maturation. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (February 27, 1807 – March 24, 1882) was an American poet whose works include Paul Revere's Ride, A Psalm of Life, The Song of Hiawatha and Evangeline. He also wrote the first American translation of Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy and was one of the five members of the group known as the Fireside Poets. Longfellow was born and raised in the Portland, Maine area. He attended university at an early age at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine. After several journeys overseas, Longfellow settled for the last forty-five years of his life in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in a wood frame house once occupied during the American Revolution by General George Washington and his staff. Early life and education Birthplace in c. 1910Longfellow was born in 1807 to Stephen and Zilpah (Wadsworth) Longfellow in Portland, Maine, and grew up in what is now known as the Wadsworth-Longfellow House. His father was a lawyer, and his maternal grandfather, Peleg Wadsworth Sr., was a general in the American Revolutionary War. He was descended from the Longfellow family that came to America in 1676 from Yorkshire, England and from Priscilla and John Alden on his father's side Longfellow's siblings were Stephen (1805), Elizabeth (1808), Anne (1810), Alexander (1814), Mary (1816), Ellen (1818), and Samuel (1819). Longfellow was enrolled in a &amp;quot;dame school&amp;quot; at the age of only three, and by age six, when he entered the Portland Academy, he was able to read and write quite well. He remained at the Portland Academy until the age of fourteen and entered Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine in 1822. At Bowdoin, he met Nathaniel Hawthorne, who became his lifelong friend. He was a 5th great grandson of John Howland and Elizabeth Tilley who were on the Mayflower. First European tour and professorship at Bowdoin After graduating in 1825, he was offered a professorship at Bowdoin College with the condition that he first spend some time in Europe for further language study. He toured Europe between 1826 and 1829 (visiting England, France, Germany, Holland, Italy and Spain), and upon returning went on to become the first professor of modern languages at Bowdoin, as well as a parttime librarian. During his years at the college, he wrote textbooks in French, Italian, and Spanish and a travel book, Outre-Mer: A Pilgrimage Beyond the Sea. In 1831, he married Mary Storer Potter of Portland. Second European tour and professorship at Harvard Henry Wadsworth LongfellowLongfellow was offered the Smith Professorship of French and Spanish at Harvard with the stipulation that he spend a year or so abroad. His 22-year old wife, Mary Storer Potter died during the trip in Rotterdam after suffering a miscarriage in 1835. Three years later he was inspired to write &amp;quot;Footsteps of Angels&amp;quot; about their love. When he returned to the United States in 1836, Longfellow took up the professorship at Harvard University. He settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he remained for the rest of his life, although he spent summers at his home in Nahant. He began publishing his poetry, including &amp;quot;Voices of the Night&amp;quot; in 1839 and &amp;quot;Ballads and Other Poems&amp;quot;, which included his famous poem &amp;quot;The Village Blacksmith&amp;quot;, in 1841. Marriage to Frances &amp;quot;Fanny&amp;quot; Appleton Fanny Appleton LongfellowLongfellow began courting Frances &amp;quot;Fanny&amp;quot; Appleton, the daughter of a wealthy Boston industrialist, Nathan Appleton. During the courtship, he frequently walked from Harvard to her home in Boston, crossing the Boston Bridge. That bridge was subsequently demolished and replaced in 1906 by a new bridge, which was eventually renamed as the Longfellow Bridge. After seven years, Fanny finally agreed to marriage and they were wed in 1843. Nathan Appleton bought the Craigie House, overlooking the Charles River as a wedding present to the pair. His love for Fanny is evident in the following lines from Longfellow's only love-poem, the sonnet &amp;quot;The Evening Star,&amp;quot; which he wrote in October, 1845: &amp;quot;O my beloved, my sweet Hesperus! My morning and my evening star of love!&amp;quot; He and Fanny had six children: Charles Appleton (1844-1893) Ernest Wadsworth (1845-1921) Fanny (1847-1848) Alice Mary (1850-1928) Edith (1853-1915) Anne Allegra (1855-1934). When the younger Fanny was born on April 7, 1847, Dr. Nathan Cooley Keep administered the first obstetric anesthetic in the United States to Fanny Longfellow. Longfellow retired from Harvard in 1854, devoting himself entirely to writing. He was awarded an honorary doctorate of Laws from Harvard in 1859. The death of Frances Longfellow was a devoted husband and father with a keen feeling for the pleasures of home. But his marriages ended in sadness and tragedy. On a hot July day, while putting a lock of a child's hair into an envelope and attempting to seal it with hot sealing wax, her dress caught fire causing severe burns.She died the next day, aged 44, on July 10, 1861. Longfellow was devastated by her death and never fully recovered. The strength of his grief is still evident in these lines from a sonnet, &amp;quot;The Cross of Snow&amp;quot; (1879) which he wrote eighteen years later to commemorate her death: Such is the cross I wear upon my breast These forty five years, through all the changing scenes And seasons, changeless since the day she died. Death Longfellow died on March 24, 1882, after suffering from peritonitis for five days. He is buried with both of his wives at Mount Auburn Cemetery, Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1884 he was the first American poet for whom a commemorative sculpted bust was placed in Poet's Corner of Westminster Abbey in London. Longfellow's work Longfellow was such an admired figure in the United States during his life, that his 70th birthday in 1877 took on the air of a national holiday, with parades, speeches, and the reading of his poetry. He had become one of the first American celebrities. His work was immensely popular during his time and is still today, although some modern critics consider him too sentimental. His poetry is based on familiar and easily understood themes with simple, clear, and flowing language. His poetry created an audience in America and contributed to creating American mythology. Longfellow's poem &amp;quot;Christmas Bells&amp;quot; is the basis for the Christmas carol &amp;quot;I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day&amp;quot;. Longfellow's home in Cambridge, the Longfellow National Historic Site, is a U.S. National Historic Site, National Historic Landmark, and on the National Register of Historic Places. A two-thirds scale replica was built in Minneapolis, Minnesota at Minnehaha Park in 1906 and once served as a centerpiece for a local zoo. Noted minister, writer and abolitionist Edward Everett Hale founded organizations called the Harry Wadsworth Clubs. Trivia A number of schools are named after him in various states, including Maine, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Wisconsin, California, Minnesota, Montana, Pennsylvania, New York and Texas. &amp;quot;Longfellow Serenade&amp;quot; is a pop song by Neil Diamond. In March 2007 the United postal service made a stamp after him." id="442805746" latitude="0" license="4" longitude="0" nbComments="11" rank="63" tags="" title="Henry Wadsworth Longfellow" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/169/442805746_dc1c74b046_b.jpg" username="dbking" views="10659" />
<photo  date_taken="2007-08-27 04:19:53" description="Lyman Underwood Humphrey Union Civil war Veteran and Former Governor of Kansas. Served in Co. I, 76th OH. Volunteer Infantry. He was born at New Baltimore, Stark County, Ohio, July 25, 1844, and died at his home in Independence September 12, 1915. He had a worthy ancestry. His father Lyman Humphrey was born in Connecticut of English descent in 1799. The Humphrey ancestors located in New England during the early part of the seventeenth century. Lyman Humphrey as a young man moved out to the Western Reserve of Ohio, locating at Deerfield. That village had among its shops and other institutions a tannery, formerly owned by Jesse Grant, the father of Gen. U. S. Grant. This tannery was bought by Lyman Humphrey, but after engaging in the business for some years he took up the law as a profession. He filled a place of usefulness and influence in his community, served as a colonel of the militia, and died at the age of fifty-four. At Niles, Ohio, he married Elizabeth A. Everhart, daughter of John and Rachel (Johns) Everhart, a native of Pennsylvania. Mr. Everhart was connected with the iron industry at Niles. It is said that Mrs. Lyman Humphrey was the inspiration and encouragement to both her sons, and spurred them on to unusual accomplishment even as young men. She was in fact a woman of strong personality and character, of great native intelligence, and the devotion which she gave to her family in her years was well rewarded when she saw her son, after many other public honors were bestowed upon him, occupy the chair of governor in Kansas. She spent her last years at the home of Governor Humphrey in Independence, where she died in 1896 at the age of eighty-four. She was left a widow in 1853, and for a number of years had heavy responsibilities in connection with the rearing and training of her children. She gave two sons as soldiers to the Union. One of these sons, John E. Humphrey, was in the Nineteenth Ohio Infantry, was severely wounded at Shiloh, and on that account discharged from the army, but subsequently re-enlisted in the First Light Artillery of Ohio and served until the end. He was also a pioneer settler of Montgomery County, Kansas, where he died in 1880. Nine years of age when his father died, Lyman U. Humphrey spent his early years at the old home in Ohio, attended the public schools of New Baltimore, and had begun his course in the high school at Massillon when his education was interrupted for the sake of serving his country. October 7, 1861, at the age of seventeen, he enlisted in Company I of the Seventy-sixth Ohio Infantry. It has been well said that probably no man in Kansas had a more brilliant army record, and yet in his later career he never boasted of what he did on the field of battle, never exploited his record for the sake of advancement in politics, and it is probable that many of his stanch admirers were never aware that he had served with so much credit during the War of the Rebellion. With the Seventy-sixth Ohio, in the First Brigade, First Division, Fifteenth Army Corps, be participated in twenty-seven battles, sieges and minor engagements, including Fort Donelson, Shiloh, Corinth, Chickasaw Bluff, Arkansas Post, Jackson, Champion Hills, Black River Bridge, the siege of Vicksburg, the forced march from Memphis to Chattanooga, Lookout Mountain, Missionary Ridge, Ringgold, Resaca, New Hope Church, Kenesaw Mountain, the battle before Atlanta on July 22, 1864, Ezra Chapel, Jonesboro, Lovejoy Station, the march to the sea, Savannah, the campaign through the Carolinas, and up to and including the battle of Bentonville and the surrender of Johnston's army. At Ringgold November 27, 1863, he received his first and only wound, but lost no time from duty on that account. All this service of nearly four years, it should be noted, was rendered before he reached his majority. He was mustered out at Louisville, Kentucky, July 19, 1865, just six days before his twenty-first birthday. During the war he sent his monthly wages home to support his widowed mother, and though a youth without special influence, his faithful service gained him promotion to first sergeant of his company, and then on special recommendation from his colonel was promoted to second and first lieutenant, and was in active command of a company during the Atlanta campaign and march to the sea. A biographer has called attention to the report of an inspecting officer on the back of an old muster roll of the company he commanded. The notation follows: &amp;quot;Discipline, good; inspection, good; military appearance, good; arms and accoutrements, good; clothing, very bad.&amp;quot; Undoubtedly the qualities of determined courage and devotion to duty which he exemplified in the stern times of war stood him in good stead as governor of Kansas when he was frequently called upon to face and fight more insidious enemies and influences than confronted him in warfare of arms. Sep 14, 1915 HONORED HIS MEMORY Last Rites for Gov. Humphrey Largely Attended MANY PAY TRIBUTE Rev. Appleby Delivered the Funeral Address- Floral Offerings Very Profuse The funeral of ex-Governor Lyman U. Humphrey was held from the family residence at 10:30 o'clock this morning and was largely attended by the old friends and residents. Only a portion of those present could obtain admission to the spacious rooms. The casket was placed in the living room in front of vast banks of flowers. It was wrapped in an American flag and covered with beautiful lilies. The floral offerings were the most beautiful and elegant ever seen in the city. In the room containing the casket they appeared in artistic symbols and emblems and great clusters and extended out onto the porch in their profusion. It was beautiful and appropriate and testified to the affection felt for one of the city's and state's most distinguished citizens. The following Knights Templar acted as pallbearers: Dale Hiebrank, Hoyt Cates, Ernest Sewell, T. B. Henry, T. E. Wagstaff, J. M. Jacoby. The members of McPherson post, G. A. R., attended the services in a body and were invited into the house. The court house, city hall and the banks of the city were closed this morning out of respect to the memory of the deceased. The funeral services were very impressive in their simplicity and dignity. Mrs. Frank Stoops sang with deep feeling - &amp;quot;I Shall See Him Face to Face,&amp;quot; Rev. Appleby of the First Congregational church paid a fine tribute to the life and services of the deceased. Mr. Appleby stood in the reception hall when delivering his address so that he could be heard by both those in the house and those standing on the lawn. He said: Independence today mourns the loss of her most distinguished citizen. There is no need that on this occasion I should give his biography. It is already written for the generations to come in the history of the state that honored him, and that he, in turn, so highly honored. Would I pronounce a eulogy, it is already written in your hearts. Some one has said reputation is fleeting, honor is temporary, fame is a burden, only character endures. It is therefore fitting that we should pause at the end of a career that has been so honored and consider for a brief time some of the elements of character that made Governor Humphrey one of the great men of the state. He was born in that portion of Ohio known as the Western Reserve, a region that for decades has furnished much of the leadership of the nation. His ancestral lines ran back to Puritan New England, and his boyhood being spent in a pioneer state , he imbibed patriotism with his mother's milk, and he breathed freedom with the air of his native hills. When the great crisis of our country's history came and the drum beat of the nation was heard in 1861, he joined the mighty army that to the rhythm of marching feet were singing: &amp;quot;We are coming, Father Abraham, three hundred thousand strong.&amp;quot; He entered the army a boy of 17. When he was mustered out in the summer of 65, not yet 21 years of age, he was in command of a company. The same force of character that made him a soldier brave and true when he fought at Shiloh and Corinth, and Lookout Mountain and Missionary Ridge and a score of other battles as he followed Sherman when he went marching down from Atlanta to the sea abided with him in civil life. It was inevitable that the boy who attained an officer's commission in the army should receive recognition as a man of leadership in the years that followed. For a few years after the Civil war Governor Humphrey lived in Shelby county, Missouri, where he in turn was teacher, editor, and lawyer. He came to Independence in 1871. He was not yet 27 years old, and Independence was only a crude pioneer town. In the forty-four years that have passed no man has made a more varied contribution of his talent and strength to the making of his adopted city. Together with Charles and Thomas Yoe and certain Missouri friends he established the South Kansas Tribune, which abides to this day as one of the strong influential journals of the state. Governor Humphrey was editor and W. T. Yoe was business manager. In 1872, after having been connected with the paper for a little over a year he left the editorial tripod and engaged in the practice of law. A dozen years later in connection with George T Geuernsey and others he engaged in the banking business and was the first president of the Commercial National bank, serving in that company for six years. The same interest in public affairs that made him a soldier in the sixties led him into political life in the seventies and later. He was a member of the legislature serving both in the lower house and in the senate later becoming lieutenant governor. In 1888 he received the highest honor in the gift of the state, being elected governor by the largest plurality ever given to a candidate for a state office. Two years later the people testified to their approval of his administration by electing him for a second term. On his retirement from office he reentered business life and through the years has been honored by the community as its first citizen. This is not the time or place to make extended remarks concerning Governor Humphrey's political career; but it is certainly entirely in keeping with the proprieties to say that he gave the state a clean administration, free from scandal, and that, in the face of threats against his political life, he stood steadfastly for prohibition as the established attitude of the state toward the liquor traffic; and for this alone he should be held in in grateful and everlasting remembrance by every loyal son of Kansas. A cultured gentleman, a successful businessman, an honored public official blessed with many warm and enduring friendships, he failed to find in all these things that which satisfied his soul's highest longings. His attitude toward happiness was that of President Garfield as revealed in this story. On election night, in November, 1880, there was gathered in General Garfield's political headquarters a group of personal friends who were anxiously awaiting the election returns. The reports, fragmentary at first, soon began to point to the election of General Garfield. Finally there was no doubt about it. The waiting friends began to tender congratulations. Other congratulations began to come in over the wires from friends throughout the nation. Suddenly the pastor of the triumphant candidate said: &amp;quot;General Garfield I want to preach next Sunday morning from a text suggested by the president elect. Give me a text.&amp;quot; Then this man, who had won honors in the scholastic world and on the field of battle and in the halls of congress he who had found the tow path a highway leading to the door of the White House- he, with the highest honor in the gift of the nation his turned and instantly replied: &amp;quot;Take this: from the last verse of the seventeenth Psalm: &amp;quot;I shall be satisfied when I awake with thy likeness.&amp;quot; Even though a man attain to the highest earthly honor, nothing short of likeness to a Son of God will satisfy him. That same heart craving for more than this earth can give even to the highly successful found expression in the life of Governor Humphrey in his membership in the Congregational church and the confession of faith that it implied. For some years he was chairman of our board of trusties and he had a keen appreciation of the work of the church and all it stood for. Today his memory is honored by city and state, a multitude of friends find inspiration in his career; his home darkened by death is brightened by flowers from many sources; but that which brings the most solid and enduring comfort to the bereaved hearts of his dear ones is the message of the church that he loved and served the words of the Lord, Jesus Christ, his Master, who said: &amp;quot;I am the resurrection and the life; he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall live; and whosoever liveth, and believeth in me, shall never die.&amp;quot; The sufferings of Governor Humphrey extended through many months and there is suggested the problem of the meaning of pain. The best brief answer I have found in the words of another: The cry of man's anguish went up to God: &amp;quot;Lord take away pain-- The shadow that darkens the world thou hast made, The close coiling chain That strangles the heart, the burden that weighs On wings that would soar Lord, take away pain from the world thou hast made, That it love Thee the more.&amp;quot; Then answered the Lord to the cry and His word: &amp;quot;Shall I take away pain, And with it the power of the soul to endure, Made strong by the strain? Shall I take away pity, that knits heart to heart, And sacrifice high? Will you lose all your heroes that lift from the fire White brows to the sky? Shall I take away love, that redeems with a price And smiles at its loss? Can ye spare from your lives, that would climb into mine-- The Christ on his cross?&amp;quot; Pain, suffering, sorrow and bereavement are common to all. We can not escape them. Our only hope is to find comfort when they do come. This comfort will be just in proportion to our faith in Jesus Christ. If in our hearts we believe in Him, we will reckon the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed. Amanda Lowman Bartholomew, one our own Kansas writers has beautifully expressed this faith in these words which I close: The river's not wide, And the other side Seems nearer than ever before; The waves once so dark, Recede from the bark As I list for the dip of the oar. I shudder no more, For the splash of the oar Falls in rythmical cadence so sweet, It seems but a part Of the peace of my heart, As the waters flow nearer my feet. Now yet do I shrink, Though close to the brink The breath of the river grows chill, For through the deep roll His voice in my soul Bids the waves and all my fears be still. In the fast ebbing sand Uplifted I stand By a hand pierced for me long ago, My sins all confessed, On his bosom I rest, He will bear me safe over I know." id="1248710070" latitude="37.238272" license="6" longitude="-95.704779" nbComments="1" rank="64" tags="hobby civilwarveteran tombstonephoto lymanuhumphrey coi76thohinfantry borninnewbaltimorestarkcountyohjuly251844 mounthopecemetery independencekansas biography" title="Lyman Humphrey" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/1058/1248710070_6017038d5d_b.jpg" username="jajacks62" views="594" />
<photo  date_taken="2005-05-03 15:15:25" description="Hirshorn Gallery and Hirshorn Sculpture Garden Late 1930s The US Congress mandates a Smithsonian art museum for the National Mall; a design by Eliel Saarinen is unveiled in 1939. New York financier Joseph H. Hirshhorn (born Latvia, 1899) pursues a lifelong passion for collecting art. 1940s World War II and shifting priorities shelve the museum project. On the National Mall in Washington, DC, the only venue for visual art is the National Gallery of Art, which focuses on old masters. In the late 1940s, Joseph Hirshhorn, now in his 40s and enjoying phenomenal success from uranium mining investments, begins recrafting his collection from &amp;quot;classic&amp;quot; French Impressionism to works by living artists, American modernism of the early 20th century, and sculpture. 1950s In 1955, Joseph Hirshhorn sells his uranium interests for more than $50 million. His collection expands (late 1950s-early '60s) to warehouses, an apartment in New York, and an estate in Greenwich, Connecticut, with extensive acreage for sculpture. 1960s A 1962 sculpture show at New York's Guggenheim Museum awakens an international art community to the breadth of Hirshhorn's holdings. Word of his collection of modern and contemporary paintings also circulates, and institutions in Italy, Israel, Canada, California, and New York vie for the collection. President Lyndon B. Johnson and Smithsonian Secretary S. Dillon Ripley make a successful pitch for a new museum on Washington, DC's National Mall. An Act of Congress establishes the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Smithsonian Institution (1966). The museum is primarily federally funded, although Hirshhorn later contributes $1 million toward building construction. Joseph and his fourth wife, Olga Zatorsky Hirshhorn, visit the White House. Groundbreaking takes place in 1969. Early 1970s Founding director Abram Lerner (born 1913) oversees research, conservation, and installation of over 6,000 objects, brought from the Hirshhorns' Connecticut estate and other properties to Washington, DC. The museum building and garden complex, designed by Gordon Bunshaft (1909-1990) of Skidmore, Owings &amp;amp; Merrill, nears completion on the National Mall. Ambassador Daniel Patrick Moynihan chairs the Hirshhorn's first Board of Trustees. The New York Times: &amp;quot;... a fortress of a building that works as a museum.&amp;quot; Joseph Hirshhorn speaks at the inauguration (1974), saying: &amp;quot;It is an honor to have given my art collection to the people of the United States as a small repayment for what this nation has done for me and others like me who arrived here as immigrants. What I accomplished in the United States I could not have accomplished anywhere else in the world.&amp;quot; One million visitors see the 850-work inaugural show in the first six months. ARCHITECTURE Design Concept Bunshaft conceived the Hirshhorn as &amp;quot;a large piece of functional sculpture&amp;quot; among the shrinelike structures of the National Mall. The hollow-centered, elevated cylinder-primarily a gallery for paintings-floats above nearly four acres of landscaped grounds for sculpture. Curved galleries expand the visitor's view of works. Window-walls open the interior and focus on the fountain, while a recessed garden provides serenity. Like the round Guggenheim Museum in New York, the drum-shaped Hirshhorn is bold compared with its neighbors (Mall constructions tend to be brick Victorian fantasies, modernist block buildings, or neoclassical temples), but symmetry and frontality conserve the official Washington, DC, architectural mode. The plaza was redesigned in 1991 to create six &amp;quot;rooms&amp;quot; of inviting, verdant space for the display of a selection of large-scale contemporary sculptures in the Hirshhorn collection. The building's four piers serve as sheltered coves for more intimately sized works. The fountain holds fascination for young and old alike as the central water jet shoots up almost four stories. Special events such as concerts and workshops often take place between the piers, under the &amp;quot;drum&amp;quot; of the building, and on the granite-paved plaza. The Hirshorn is the only building on the National Mall named for an individual. Siting The Hirshhorn is sited exactly halfway between the Washington Monument and the US Capitol, anchoring the southernmost end of the so-called L'Enfant axis (perpendicular to the Mall's green carpet). The National Archives/National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden across the Mall, and the National Portrait Gallery/Smithsonian American Art building several blocks to the north, also mark this pivotal axis, a key element of both the 1791 city plan by Pierre L'Enfant and the 1901 MacMillan Plan. Technical Information •Building and walls surfaced with precast concrete aggregate of &amp;quot;Swenson&amp;quot; pink granite •Building is 231 feet in diameter; interior court, 115 feet; fountain, 60 feet •Building is 82 feet high, elevated 14 feet on four massive, sculptural piers •60,000 square feet of exhibition space on three floors •197,000 square feet of total exhibition space, indoors and outdoors •274-seat auditorium (lower level) •2.7 acres around and under the museum building •1.3-acre sculpture garden across Jefferson Drive sunken 6-14 feet below street level, ramped for accessibility •Second- and third-floor galleries have 15-foot-high walls, with exposed 3-foot-deep coffered ceilings •Lower level includes exhibition space, storage, workshops, offices •Fourth floor includes offices, storage Architectural Timeline 1969. The Hirshhorn Museum groundbreaking takes place on the former site of the Army Medical Museum (built 1887) after that brick structure is demolished. A controversy soon develops over naming a building on the historic National Mall after a living person, as well as the new federal museum's modern look and intrusively expansive sculptural grounds. 1971. Amid this climate of controversy, Bunshaft's original conception for the Sculpture Garden-an elongated, sunken rectangle crossing the Mall with a large reflecting pool-is abandoned. He prepares a new design based on an idea outlined by art critic Benjamin Forgey in a Washington Star article. The new adaptation shifts the garden's Mall orientation from perpendicular to parallel and reduces its size from 2 acres to 1.3 acres. The design is deliberately stark, using gravel surfaces and minimal plantings to visually emphasize the works of art. 1974. The museum opens with three floors of painting galleries, a fountain plaza for sculpture, and the Sculpture Garden. In preparation for the opening, Hirshhorn curators and staff spend several months scrupulously planning the locations of artworks, both indoors and outdoors. Lightweight foam-core &amp;quot;dummy&amp;quot; sculptures are used to resolve the final placement of works in the garden. The originals, many of which had been airlifted from Hirshhorn's Connecticut estate onto flatbed trucks for transport, are put into place in the weeks before the opening. 1981. Closed since the summer of 1979, the Sculpture Garden reopens in September after a renovation and redesign by Lester Collins, a well-known landscape architect and founder of the Innesfree Foundation. The design introduces plantings, paved surfaces, accessibility ramps, and areas of lawn. 1985. The Museum Shop is moved to the lobby, increasing exhibition space at its former location on the lower level. 1993. Closed since December 1991, the Hirshhorn Plaza reopens after a renovation and redesign by landscape architect James Urban. The 2.7-acre area around and under the building is repaved in two tones of gray granite, and raised areas of grass and trees are added to the east and west. THE FOUNDING DONOR The Hirshhorn Museum's founding donor, Joseph H. Hirshhorn (1899-1981), immigrated to New York from Latvia when he was 4 years old. His widowed mother settled with her 13 children (Joseph was the twelfth) in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. In time, Hirshhorn would become a financier, philanthropist, and well-known collector of modern art whose gift to the Nation of 6,000 paintings, sculptures, drawings, and mixed-media pieces established his namesake museum on the National Mall. It has been open to the public since 1974. At the age of 13, Joseph left school to become a newsboy. Two years later he took his first salaried job, on Wall Street in Manhattan, earning $12 per week. At 16, he launched his career as a financier by using his savings of $255 to become a stockbroker. When he was 18, Hirshhorn acquired his first works of art: two etchings by the 16th-century German artist Albrecht Dürer, purchased for $75 each. This acquisition marked the beginning of a lifelong passion for collecting art, assisted by an innate talent for making money. In the late 1940s, Hirshhorn's mining investments in uranium-rich Canadian land cemented his status as a wealthy man. Hirshhorn eventually turned his attention to the art of contemporary masters. He became an avid collector of works by living painters such as Arshile Gorky, Stuart Davis, Edward Hopper, Milton Avery, Raphael Soyer, and Larry Rivers. He socialized and visited with many of these artists and assisted them when he could-helping his friend Willem de Kooning, for example, finance the construction of a Long Island studio in exchange for works of art. As a collector, Hirshhorn also went after works by American painters of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Thomas Eakins, Louis Eilshemius, Ashcan School artists, and first-wave modernists in touch with European developments are prime examples. Hirshhorn was a frequent and welcome visitor in the studios of those whose works he collected, and many of these visits were commemorated in photographs. One such occasion was a 1966 visit to Pablo Picasso at Mas Notre Dame de Vie, near Mougins, in the south of France. Bearded photographer Edward Steichen was a guest of the Hirshhorns at their house : Villa Lou Miradou, in Cap d'Antibes. Ultimately, Hirshhorn was perhaps best known as a collector of 19th- and 20th-century sculpture. He acquired major works by pioneers such as Auguste Rodin and Constantin Brancusi, as well as innovative contemporaries including Alexander Calder, Henry Moore, and Alberto Giacometti. Developing fast friendships, Hirshhorn showed his enthusiasm in numerous ways: by visiting Moore's studio, for instance, and enjoying the art scene with Giacometti. The breadth of Hirshhorn's sculpture collection was unknown to the general public until 1962, when selected works were loaned to the Guggenheim Museum in New York for a major exhibition. Several international museums and governments courted Hirshhorn, but his comprehensive modern art holdings ultimately went to the Smithsonian Institution. Lady Bird Johnson, wife of then-President Lyndon B. Johnson, played a supporting role by paying personal visits to Joseph and his wife, Olga. After an Act of Congress established the Hirshhorn Museum in 1966, the Johnsons joined the Hirshhorns for the museum's groundbreaking in January 1969, just prior to the inauguration of President Richard M. Nixon. Among the numerous honors afforded this self-made philanthropist during his lifetime was, appropriately, the Horatio Alger Award in 1976. The award is designed to honor determination, perseverance, and success in the face of adversity. Dividing his time between Washington, DC, and Naples, Florida, Joseph Hirshhorn remained a vigorous art collector and patron until his death in 1981. His subsequent bequest to the museum nearly doubled the size of the collection. Building on this nucleus of Hirshhorn artworks, curators keep current on new art while refining the collection, which today numbers some 11,500 pieces. A constant stream of new acquisitions, including curators' purchases and gifts of art from many donors, extends the Hirshhorn legacy of passion for new art. The Hirshhorn Sculpture Garden Located on the National Mall halfway between the Washington Monument and the US Capitol, the Sculpture Garden provides a contemplative haven for viewing over 60 works of art. These large-scale sculptures date from the 1880s to the 1960s and explore the same stylistic progression of ideas and styles as the small and mid-sized works in the Hirshhorn interior galleries. The works exemplify a wide range of styles, including traditional figures by artists such as Auguste Rodin and Aristide Maillol, biomorphic abstraction by artists such as Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth, and boldly abstract and kinetic compositions by artists such as Alexander Calder and Mark di Suvero." id="87116281" latitude="0" license="4" longitude="0" nbComments="0" rank="65" tags="" title="Hirshorn Gallery of Art" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/42/87116281_99e948f0ce_b.jpg" username="dbking" views="9081" />

SMITH-There came to Montgomery couuty, among the pioneers of the year 1870, one whose life has been interwoven with the interests of agruculture in the county and one who. althoxigh now inactive and a spectator of events herein, is still alive to whatever pertains to the material or other worthy interests of the county. In this connection, we refer to him whose name introduces this personal notice. William N. Smith came to Kansas by &amp;quot;prairie express,&amp;quot; as it were, driving all the way from the State of Missouri, and settling near Tyro, among a few neighbors who were, many of them, in as straightened circumstances as himself. His few personal effects wei'e packed away in his wagon and his family of wife and two children, constituted his chief center of interest. His permanent settlement, near Tyro, occurred some two years ago subsequent to his firsl settlement in the state, which settlement occurred near Lafontain, in Wilson county, about the first of the year, 1871. Until 1884, he lived uiton rented laud. but. that year, purchased a tract in Fawn Creek township, which he improved and cultivated till his removal to Chautauqua county, in 1896, and located near Brownsville. Eeturning to Montgomery county, in two years, he took up his residence in Independence, where he has since maintained his home. He yet owns the farm near Brownsville and another, of two hundred acres, on Rock creek, in Montgomery county, making a total of five hundred and twenty acres of land. Bucks county, Pennsylvania, was the native plate of William N. Smith, and February 17, 1840, was the date of his birth. His father was John T. Smith and his granfather was an Irishman, who married an English lady and settled in Bucks county. Pennsylvania, and reared three sons and two daughters, and there died. The issue of this worthy couple were: James, who ran a canal boat in Pennsylvania in early life; John T., and Charlotte, who became the wife of Lewis Vandergrift and was a resident of Peoria, Illinois. John T. Smith, our subject's father, was born in Bucks county, the &amp;quot;Keystone State,&amp;quot; and was married there, in 1839, to Ann Bates. His wife was a native of the same state and was born in ISlfi. Their children were: William N., Elwood, decaeased; Chas. C., of Marshall county, llliuois; Angeline, deceased; Arabella, wife of John Clift. of Fairbury, Illinois; Louis V., a grain merchant of Henry, Illinois; Brooks, who died at fourteen years; Lottie, who became the wife of Thomas Monier, of Henry. Illinois; and Jennie, who married Mr. Gregory, of Marshall county, Illinois. William N. Smith was his father's oldest cliild. He was reared to industry and honesty, in his native state, and in Illinois, where his parents settled when he was a boy. His fathei's farm furnished scenes of his early activity and his life was somewhat monotonous and prosaic till the approach of manhood's estato, wlicn, on December 5, 1858, he married ICllon G. Bradley, in Mercor county, Missouri. The father of Mrs. William N. Smith was Joseph Bradley and her mother was Almira Thompson, the father a native of Connecticut and the other of Illinois. The Bradley children were: Ellen G. (Mrs. Smith) ; William, of Oklahoma; Clara, widow of Jacob Smith, of Enid Oklahoma; Prances, widow of William McCloud, of Pueblo, Colorado; Josephine, wife of L. D. Boatman, of Mercer county, Missouri; Gideon L., deceased; Louise M., deceased wife of Ilomcr Brand; ^Mrs. Emma Lenhart, deceased; Almira, deceased, who married John Gaskill, and Joseph, of Oklahoma. The father of this family died in Montgomery county, Kansas, in 187G. at sixty-tive years of age and his wife died here in 1880. The Bradleys of this family emanated from Connecticut, where William, grandfather of Mrs. Smith, was born. His forefathers were English and he married Eleanor Burr. Almira Thompson, Mrs. Smith's mother, was a daughter of Elias Thompson, a major in the Revolutionary war, afterward a noted Indian fighter and a &amp;quot;forty-niner&amp;quot; to California, where he died and is buried. March 11, 1841, Ellen G. (Bradley) Smith was born in Marshall county, Illinois. Her children, by her union with Mr. Smith, were: John, who was born in 1860, married Annie Wadsworth and was accidentally killed in 1885, leaving one child: William; Frank B. Smith, the second son, was born in 1862, February 25. and was married in 1885. to Elzetta Davidson. They have two children : Frances and Orriu J. Mr. Smith's residence in Montgomery county has demonstrated his genuine citizenship. His loyalty and patriotism were demonstrated on the field of blood and carnage during the Civil war and his interest in civil affairs, by his connection with the politics of the county. As a soldier, he served in the Third Missouri Cavalry, enlisting at Princeton and serving three years and twenty-five days. He fought against the armies of Price and Shelby, and in the states of Missouri, Arkansas and Kansas, he experienced service, under command of Col. King. His regiment met and defeated the Confederate Gen. Marmaduke, at Springfield, Missouri. When in active life, his connection with the politics of the county was somewhat spirited. As a Republican, he was elected justice of the peace and trustee of his township, and his party chose him as their candidate for Commissioner of the southern district and elected him, in 1888. While a member of the board, the court-house grounds were improved and beautified and the purchase of the county farm, took place. He is a Mason and a prominent member of the local Grand Army organization." id="1166046222" latitude="37.033665" license="6" longitude="-95.719285" nbComments="1" rank="66" tags="hobby civilwarveteran tombstonephoto robbinscemetery montgomerycountykansas williamnsmith grandarmyoftherepublicmember union companyf3rdmissourismcavalry missouri" title="William N.

Infantry Lost his right leg in the Battle of the Wilderness From &amp;quot;A Standard History of Kansas and Kansans&amp;quot;, written &amp;amp; compiled by William E. Connelley Orpheus S. Woodward COL. ORPHEUS S. WOODWARD. The career of Colonel Woodward, who is past fourscore and is one of the most honored and respected citizens of Neosho Falls, represents a broad track of useful effort and service, beginning as a teacher, changing to the dangerous occupation as a soldier in the Civil war, subsequently as a rancher, business man, public official in Kansas, where he has lived the greater part of the last half century. Colonel Woodward was born in Erie County, Pennsylvania, May 1, 1835. The Woodwards were colonial Americans, tracing their original home to England. It is probable that the first point of settlement in America was in Connecticut. Oliver Woodward, grandfather of Colonel Woodward, was born April 12, 1772 lived in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Illinois, and died at Barry, Illinois, about 1847. Ebenezer Woodward, father of Colonel Woodward, was born in Ohio April 16, 1804. He grew up in his native state, was married in Erie County, Pennsylvania, where he spent many years as a farmer and carpenter and finally retired to San Diego, California, where he died January 25, 1882. In early life he became a whig, and from that party transferred his allegiance to the republican organization when it came into existence. He was a very active worker in the Methodist Episcopal Church and for many years a pillar in his local society. Ebenezer Woodward married Cornelia Prindle, who was born in Erie County, Pennsylvania, May 31, 1814, and died at Harbor Creek in the same county December 17, 1855. Her children were: Augustus G., who was born May 1, 1833, and is now a retired blacksmith living at Tulare, California. The second in the family is Col. O. S. Woodward. Caroline, born August 4, 1839, married Charles Keller, a rancher at Kaweah, California. Mary Cornelia, born March 23, 1848, was married April 8, 1866, to Robert Cowden, a farmer now deceased, and she now spends her time partly in California and partly in Pennsylvania with her children. Georgia is living at Los Angeles, the widow of John Desmond a farmer. Orpheus S. Woodward spent his early life in that interesting and historic section of Northwestern Pennsylvania where he was born. He attended the public schools, also the Waterford Academy and the Northwestern State Normal School at Edinboro, Pennsylvania. His work as a schoolmaster was done through portions of about five years. In 1861 Colonel Woodward enlisted in the Eighty-third Regiment of Pennsylvania Infantry. The record of that regiment during the war is practically the record of Colonel Woodward's personal service. He was in nearly all the important battles of the Fifth Army Corps. He was at Antietam, at Fredericksburg, at Chancellorsville, at Gettysburg, the battle of the Wilderness, Gaines Mills, Malvern Hill, and during the hottest of the fighting in the wilderness in May, 1864, he was wounded and being incapacitated for further service was given an honorable discharge in the following September. At the close of his military career he returned to Waterford, Pennsylvania, and while living there was twice elected a member of the Pennsylvania Legislature, being chosen on the republican ticket. Colonel Woodward came to Kansas in 1868. His first location was at Humboldt, but he soon afterwards located on a ranch in Woodson County and directed its operations for a couple of years. He then came to Neosho Falls, and from the spring of 1870 for eight years was in the hardware business. Colonel Woodward then returned East to Erie, Pennsylvania, and spent three years in that city and in Youngstown, Ohio, but with that exception has been a resident of Neosho Falls for over forty-five years. Since locating there in 1883 he has given his time chiefly to the management of his farms and varied business interests. Colonel Woodward owns a farm of 420 acres near Yates Center and another place of 21 acres on the Neosho River, also in Woodson County. One of the landmarks of Neosho Falls is the Woodward home, situated on five acres of ground at Oak and Eighth streets. His presence in Neosho Falls has not been without corresponding benefit to the community. For many years he was a member of the school board, served several terms as mayor, and also as a member of the council. He acted several times as master of Tuscan Lodge, No. 82, Ancient Free and Accepted Masons and is past commander of Neosho Falls Post, Grand Army of the Republic, and belongs to the military order of the Loyal Legion. During the administration of Governor Humphrey Colonel Woodward served as a member of the Kansas State Senate. He was brevetted brigadier general. About the time he went into the army Colonel Woodward was happily married at Waterford, Pennsylvania, September 9, 1861, to Miss Marietta Himrod. She was of an old and prominent family of Western Pennsylvania. She was born at Waterford February 12, 1837 and died at Neosho Falls, Kansas, April 11, 1887. Her parents were David and Abigail (Patten) Himrod. Her father died at Waterford, Pennsylvania, November 23, 1877, and her mother at Chicago, Illinois, January 29, 1899. Colonel Woodward has three children. Anna Cornelia presides over the domestic arrangements of Colonel Woodward and is also a very capable business woman and has the supervision of her father's farm. Kate Abigail, who lives at Pewaukee, Wisconsin, is the widow of George Franklin Clark, who followed farming during his lifetime. Mary Alice first married James S. McDonald, a publisher, and is now the wife of Joseph B. Ruff, who is superintendent of a department of the firm of Hirsch-Stein Company at Hammond, Indiana. The Neosho Falls Post, Thursday, July 3, 1919, Pg 1 Colonel Orpheus S. Woodward ______ Our distinguished citizen and our good friend has been called hence, and life after a great loss can never be quite the same again. But it is a genuine consolation to recount the leading characteristics of this loyal and courageous soldier, this manly man, this refined and cultivated gentleman. We have been so fortunate in having such a character among us through the long years. It is such a high privilege to pay such tribute as we may. Orpheus S. Woodward was born May 1, 1835, at Harborville Pennsylvania. He was fortunate in his birth in a sterling Christian home. He had good educational advantages for the time, and had achieved success as a teacher when the first call came for the Civil War in April of ’61. He enlisted at once as a private on the ninety day provision. Then the 83rd Pennsylvania regiment was organized, he was selected as a captain in this unit, and was married in September of that year to Marietta Himrod, a woman of rare quality and a war-bride most worthy of her chosen man. Captain Woodward went at once to the front after this great event, and during the war participated in a score of great battles. After Gettysburg he was promoted to a colonelcy, and during the battle of the Wilderness he was so severely wounded that the amputation of his leg was necessary. He was brevetted brigadier-general for his conspicuous courage and efficiency, and upon his return to private life he heard the call of Kansas, and engaged in farming on Cherry Creek in this county in ’68. He later secured a place on Owl Creek, and also entered into the hardware business at Toronto and Neosho Falls with D. W. Finney, who had also served in the Civil War, and until his death two years since, one of our most prominent citizens. In ’71 the Woodward family moved into our favored town and became at once a strong factor in the life of the community. The business prospered, but after some years was sold out to Mr. Finney in order to enter into a better opening in Pennsylvania. But the family returned again to Neosho Falls, and though Mrs. Woodward passed on thirty years age, the three daughters remained. Miss Kate and Miss Alice went into homes of their own in the process of time, but Miss Anna has been her father’s constant companion and stay, and the home has stood during all this period for high thought and fine feeling and cordial hospitality. This latter part of Col. Woodward’s life has been spent in farming interests and cattle breeding, and he was very fond of his garden, his poultry and his bees and his flowers. He was a notable figure in the politics of the state, and served with honor, as he did in all things, at one time in the State Senate. And in all local matters his fine judgment and ready action could always be depended upon. The more recent years were filled with accession of pain and suffering, but he strove to keep in touch with public matters with all his native courage, and he endured his deprivations with such a fine spirit that those who tried to strengthen and cheer him received fare more than they ever gave. And finally the time came, surrounded by the most loving and efficient care, for his long sleep. The sun goes down at the close of the day, but the night is full of stars. It was an unusually long and distinctive life, and all life has been greatly enriched thereby. He sleeps beneath the flag he loved, and it is our flag, too. He was ready to make the supreme sacrifice for his country, and we enjoy the benefits he gained for us. How shall we best perpetuate the vital forces he employed? A very simple and appropriate funeral service was held at the home on last Sunday afternoon at five o’clock, and it was largely attended by old and devoted friends from Yates Center, Iola, Emporia and Independence, as well as an interested concourse from town and country side. The casket, draped in the Loyal Legion flag, was placed in the reception hall in a bower of luxuriant flowers redolent of the general sympathy, and Miss Florence L. Snow, out of her long intimacy with the family, read the nineteen Psalm as her choice of the finest expression for the occasion, following it with a brief appreciation of the beloved character. The beautiful song “Calling Me” as rendered by John McCormick, was played on the victrola, and after the last look into the face to be seen upon the earth no more, interment was made in the Cedarvale cemetery. The impressive ceremony of the Grand Army of the Republic was used at the beautifully prepared grave, conducted by Commander Jackson of the Neosho Falls Post and Chaplain Daymude of the Yates Center Post. Every heart was especially touched by the part taken by Col. W. L. Parsons, so long the heart-friend and comrade of Col. Woodward, his voice trembling with his emotion, and his face reflecting the light that shines from the other side. Taps was sounded by Mr. Ray Pyke in the uniform of the late war, and Orpheus S. Woodward waits the reveille of the morning. The two surviving daughters, Miss Anna Woodward and Mrs. Alice Ruff, who has returned to the old town for a permanent home, with one grand-child, Mr. Ben Clark of Pewaukee, Wisconsin, were all the immediate relatives present at the obsequies. Mr. Clark has but recently returned from war service in France, and another grandchild, Miss Helen McDonald has also arrived safely on this side after two years Red Cross hospital work overseas, being like her mother, Mrs. Ruff, a registered nurse. Miss Marietta Clark, is still in University training. What a blessed thing it is to live in a little good town like this where we are all like one big family and take an endless interest in each other. F.L.S. Pages 882-884, from History of Allen and Woodson Counties, Kansas: embellished with portraits of well known people of these counties, with biographies of our representative citizens, cuts of public buildings and a map of each county / Edited and Compiled by L. Wallace Duncan and Chas. F. Scott. Iola Registers, Printers and Binders, Iola, Kan.: 1901 ORPHEUS S. WOODWARD ORPHEUS S. WOODWARD, who is practically living a retired life in Neosho Falls, has met with creditable success in business, his honorable career having gained for him the high regard of all with whom he has been associated. He was born in Erie county, Pennsylvania, on the 1st of May, 1835, and is a son of Ebenezer Woodward, whose birth occurred in New York on the 15th of April, 1804. When a young man the father went to Pennsylvania and was there married to Miss Cornelia Prindle, who was born in Erie county, May 31, 1814. Through the greater part of his business career he carried on agricultural pursuits. The wife died December 17, 1855, at the age of forty-one years, and in 1876 he went to California where his death occurred July 25, 1882, when he was seventy-eight years of age. This worthy couple were the parents of seven children, five of whom are now living, namely: Augustus G., a resident of Tulare, California; Mrs. Caroline Keller, a resident of Oregon; Mary, the wife Robert Cowden, who resides on the old homestead in Pennsylvania; Mrs. Georgia Desmond of Santa Paula, Cal., and O. S., of this review. In taking up the personal history of Mr. Woodward we present to our leaders one of the most prominent men of Woodson county. In this community not to know him is to argue one's self unknown. No event of special importance occurred to vary the routine of farm life for him in his youth. He was reared on the old homestead in Pennsylvania and pursued his studies in the country schools, completing his education in the Academy of Waterford, Pennsylvania. After leaving that institution he engaged in teaching for four years in the public schools and was then chosen principal of the Northwestern Normal School of Pennsylvania, in which capacity he served for a year and a half. When the war broke out he put aside all personal considerations, for his patriotic spirit was aroused by the attempt of the south to overthrow the Union. He therefore enlisted as a private in McLain's Erie regiment on the 16th of April, 1861, and served for three months. On the expiration of that period he returned home and again entered his country's service in September, 1861, at which time he was assigned to Company D, of the Eighty-third Regiment of Pennsylvania Volunteers and was chosen captain, serving in that capacity until 1863, when on the 8th of July he was promoted to the rank of colonel, and subsequently brevet brigadier general for gallant and meritorious services. He participated in many battles and skirmishes, among which were he important engagements at Antietam, Chancellorsville, Gain's Mills, Malvern Hill, Fair Oaks, Mine Run, Gettysburg, Rappahannock Station, where he commanded the corps skirmishers, and the Wilderness. He was in every battle in which his regiment was engaged except at Second Bull Run and Fredericksburg. Colonel Woodward was wounded through the left arm at the battle of Malvern Hill and at the battle of the Wilderness he lost his right leg, sustaining injuries which necessitated its amputation above the knee. He was never captured and on many an occasion his own personal valor inspired his men, his bravery proving an important factor in winning the day. His was a noble record of which he has every reason to be proud. When the war was over Colonel Woodward returned home to his young wife, whom he married in the interim between his first and second enlistments. It was on the 9th of September, 1861, that Miss Marietta Himrod of Waterford, Pennsylvania, became his wife. She is a daughter of David and Abigail Himrod. Their marriage has been blessed with three children: Anna, who is at home: Kate, the wife of G. F. Clark, now of Pewaukee, Wisconsin; and Alice, the wife of J. S. McDonald, jr., who resides in Chicago. Mrs. Woodward died April 11, 1887, and is buried in Neosho Falls cemetery. Colonel Woodward has ever been prominent in public affairs. Immediately after his return from the war in 1865 he became a recognized leader in political circles in Pennsylvania and served in the house of representatives through the session of 1865-6. In the latter year he was re-elected for a second term and did much towards shaping the legislature of his state in the epoch which followed the Civil war. In April, 1868, he arrived in Kansas and Woodson county gained thereby a valued citizen. He purchased a farm and continued its cultivation until 1871, when he removed to Neosho Falls and embarked in the hardware business, continuing in that enterprise for twelve years. He has been very successful in his business transactions and today owns five hundred acres of valuable land in Woodson county, all improved and bringing to him a handsome income. He had not been long in Kansas when his ability for leadership gained him prominence in the republican ranks of this state, and in 1888, he was elected to the senate where he served for four years, representing Woodson and Allen counties. He has ever been a stalwart republican and his services in office have won for him the highest commendation and have demonstrated beyond doubt his fidelity to the best interests of his constituents. Mr. Woodward holds membership in the Masonic fraternity, belonging to Neosho Falls lodge, and also in the G. A. R. He has a very pleasant home presided over by Miss Anna Woodward and celebrated for its gracious hospitality which is enjoyed by a very extensive circle of friends. The colonel's career illustrates the possibilities that are open in this country to earnest and persevering young men who have the courage of their convictions and are determined to be the architects of their own fortunes. When judged by what he has accomplished, his right to a first place among the representative citizens of Neosho Falls cannot be questioned. He has ever been true and loyal to principle and in the legislative halls of two states, as well as upon the battle fields of the south, he has manifested his love for the old flag and the cause which it represents." id="1044145524" latitude="38.004346" license="6" longitude="-95.557622" nbComments="2" rank="68" tags="hobby civilwarveteran tombstonephoto orpheusswoodward captainofcompanyf83rdpainfantry colonelof83rdpainfantry lostleginbattleofthewilderness bornmay11835 diedjune261919 bornmay11835atharborvillepa pennsylvania union cedarvalecemetery neoshofallskansas biography" title="Orpheus S.

Description Ilex opaca is a medium-sized broadleaved evergreen tree growing to 10–20 m tall, exceptionally up to 30 m tall, with a trunk diameter typically up to 50 cm, exceptionally 120 cm. The bark is light gray, roughened by small warty lumps. The branchlets are stout, green at first and covered with rusty down, later smooth and brown. The winter buds are brown, short, obtuse or acute. The leaves are alternate, 5–7.5 cm long and 2–4 cm broad, stiff, yellow green and dull matte to sub-shiny above (distinctly less glossy than the otherwise fairly similar European Holly Ilex aquifolium[2]), often pale yellow beneath; the edges are curved into several sharp, spike-like points, and a wedge-shaped base and acute apex; the midrib is prominent and depressed, the primary veins conspicuous; the petiole is short, stout, grooved, thickened at base, with a pair of minute stipules. The leaves remain on the branches for two to three years, finally falling in the spring when pushed off by growing buds The flowers are greenish white, small, borne in late spring in short pedunculate cymes from the axils of young leaves or scattered along the base of young branches. The calyx is small, four-lobed, imbricate in the bud, acute, margins ciliate, persistent. The corolla is white, with four petal-like lobes united at the base, obtuse, spreading, hypogynous, imbricate in bud. The flower stem is hairy with a minute bract at base. Like all hollies, it is dioecious, with separate male and female plants; only female plants produce the characteristic red berries. One male can pollenize several females. Male flowers have four stamens, inserted on the base of the corolla, alternate with its lobes; filaments awl-shaped, exserted in the sterile, much shorter in the sterile flower; anthers attached at the back, oblong, introrse, two-celled, cells opening longitudinally. The pistil on female flowers has a superior ovary, four-celled, rudimentary in staminate flowers; style wanting, stigma sessile, four-lobed; ovules one or two in each cell. The fruit is a small red drupe 6–12 mm diameter containing four seeds; it is often persistent into winter Ecology The Ilex opaca species typically grows as an understory tree in forests. It is rare in the north of its range in southern Connecticut, southeastern New York, and isolated areas of Cape Cod, and always small there. It is abundant further south on the southern coast and in the Gulf states, reaching its greatest size on the bottomlands of southern Arkansas and eastern Texas. The branches are short and slender. The roots are thick and fleshy. It will grow in both dry and swampy soil, but grows slowly.[1][4] Ilex opaca var. arenicola, or scrub holly, is found as a shrub component in xeric scrub habitats of the Florida peninsula. The flowers are pollinated by insects, including bees, wasps, ants, and night-flying moths. The berries are reputedly poisonous to humans, but are important survival food for birds, who will eat the berries after other food sources are exhausted. The tree also forms a thick canopy which offers protection for birds from predators and storms. Songbirds including thrushes, mockingbirds, catbirds, bluebirds and thrashers frequently feed on the berries Cultivation and uses The wood is very pale, tough, close-grained, takes a good polish, and is used for whip-handles, engraving blocks, and cabinet work. It can also be dyed and used as a substitute for ebony. It has a density 0.58 to 0.64. The sap is watery, and contains a bitter substance which possesses tonic properties Ornamental plant Ilex opaca is often cultivated by plant nurseries for use as a broadleaf evergreen ornamental plant, planted as a shrub or slower growing ornamental tree. Over 1,000 cultivars have been selected, including plants selected for cold tolerance ('Cobalt', a male cultivar, is able to tolerate temperatures as low as −32 °C), growth form (e.g. dwarf forms such as 'Cardinal Hedge', a female plant growing to 1.2 m tall), and color and abundance of fruit (notable female cultivars including the large-berried 'Yule', and the yellow-berried 'Canary' and 'Morgan Gold') Holiday decoration Holly is a popular winter Christmas and holiday season decoration. In English poetry and English stories the Holly is inseparably connected with the merry-making and greetings which gather around the Christmas time. The custom is followed in North America, and holly and mistletoe are widely used for decoration of homes and churches. The European Holly does not grow in the climate of most of the United States, but the American Holly makes an excellent second choice for it closely resembles the European species. The leaves are similar in outline and toothed and bristled very much the same way, but they are a paler green and the surface gloss is duller than in the European species. American holly is the state tree of Delaware." id="7263478452" latitude="0" license="3" longitude="0" nbComments="0" rank="69" tags="cultivarplants ornamentalplants americasouthernplants nikon nikoncoolpix americaplants texasplants wacoplants fruitplants americanholly aquifoliaceae Taxonomy:binomial=ilexopaca" title="American Holly, Ilex opaca ....#4" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/8160/7263478452_f51526bba5_b.jpg" username="Vietnam Plants &amp; The USA. plants" views="55" />

The corolla is white, with four petal-like lobes united at the base, obtuse, spreading, hypogynous, imbricate in bud. The flower stem is hairy with a minute bract at base. Like all hollies, it is dioecious, with separate male and female plants; only female plants produce the characteristic red berries. One male can pollenize several females. Male flowers have four stamens, inserted on the base of the corolla, alternate with its lobes; filaments awl-shaped, exserted in the sterile, much shorter in the sterile flower; anthers attached at the back, oblong, introrse, two-celled, cells opening longitudinally. The pistil on female flowers has a superior ovary, four-celled, rudimentary in staminate flowers; style wanting, stigma sessile, four-lobed; ovules one or two in each cell. The fruit is a small red drupe 6–12 mm diameter containing four seeds; it is often persistent into winter Ecology The Ilex opaca species typically grows as an understory tree in forests. It is rare in the north of its range in southern Connecticut, southeastern New York, and isolated areas of Cape Cod, and always small there. It is abundant further south on the southern coast and in the Gulf states, reaching its greatest size on the bottomlands of southern Arkansas and eastern Texas. The branches are short and slender. The roots are thick and fleshy. It will grow in both dry and swampy soil, but grows slowly.[1][4] Ilex opaca var. arenicola, or scrub holly, is found as a shrub component in xeric scrub habitats of the Florida peninsula. The flowers are pollinated by insects, including bees, wasps, ants, and night-flying moths. The berries are reputedly poisonous to humans, but are important survival food for birds, who will eat the berries after other food sources are exhausted. The tree also forms a thick canopy which offers protection for birds from predators and storms. Songbirds including thrushes, mockingbirds, catbirds, bluebirds and thrashers frequently feed on the berries Cultivation and uses The wood is very pale, tough, close-grained, takes a good polish, and is used for whip-handles, engraving blocks, and cabinet work. It can also be dyed and used as a substitute for ebony. It has a density 0.58 to 0.64. The sap is watery, and contains a bitter substance which possesses tonic properties Ornamental plant Ilex opaca is often cultivated by plant nurseries for use as a broadleaf evergreen ornamental plant, planted as a shrub or slower growing ornamental tree. Over 1,000 cultivars have been selected, including plants selected for cold tolerance ('Cobalt', a male cultivar, is able to tolerate temperatures as low as −32 °C), growth form (e.g. dwarf forms such as 'Cardinal Hedge', a female plant growing to 1.2 m tall), and color and abundance of fruit (notable female cultivars including the large-berried 'Yule', and the yellow-berried 'Canary' and 'Morgan Gold') Holiday decoration Holly is a popular winter Christmas and holiday season decoration. In English poetry and English stories the Holly is inseparably connected with the merry-making and greetings which gather around the Christmas time. The custom is followed in North America, and holly and mistletoe are widely used for decoration of homes and churches. The European Holly does not grow in the climate of most of the United States, but the American Holly makes an excellent second choice for it closely resembles the European species. The leaves are similar in outline and toothed and bristled very much the same way, but they are a paler green and the surface gloss is duller than in the European species.

The fruit is a small red drupe 6–12 mm diameter containing four seeds; it is often persistent into winter Ecology The Ilex opaca species typically grows as an understory tree in forests. It is rare in the north of its range in southern Connecticut, southeastern New York, and isolated areas of Cape Cod, and always small there. It is abundant further south on the southern coast and in the Gulf states, reaching its greatest size on the bottomlands of southern Arkansas and eastern Texas. The branches are short and slender. The roots are thick and fleshy. It will grow in both dry and swampy soil, but grows slowly.[1][4] Ilex opaca var. arenicola, or scrub holly, is found as a shrub component in xeric scrub habitats of the Florida peninsula. The flowers are pollinated by insects, including bees, wasps, ants, and night-flying moths. The berries are reputedly poisonous to humans, but are important survival food for birds, who will eat the berries after other food sources are exhausted. The tree also forms a thick canopy which offers protection for birds from predators and storms. Songbirds including thrushes, mockingbirds, catbirds, bluebirds and thrashers frequently feed on the berries Cultivation and uses The wood is very pale, tough, close-grained, takes a good polish, and is used for whip-handles, engraving blocks, and cabinet work. It can also be dyed and used as a substitute for ebony. It has a density 0.58 to 0.64. The sap is watery, and contains a bitter substance which possesses tonic properties Ornamental plant Ilex opaca is often cultivated by plant nurseries for use as a broadleaf evergreen ornamental plant, planted as a shrub or slower growing ornamental tree. Over 1,000 cultivars have been selected, including plants selected for cold tolerance ('Cobalt', a male cultivar, is able to tolerate temperatures as low as −32 °C), growth form (e.g. dwarf forms such as 'Cardinal Hedge', a female plant growing to 1.2 m tall), and color and abundance of fruit (notable female cultivars including the large-berried 'Yule', and the yellow-berried 'Canary' and 'Morgan Gold') Holiday decoration Holly is a popular winter Christmas and holiday season decoration. In English poetry and English stories the Holly is inseparably connected with the merry-making and greetings which gather around the Christmas time. The custom is followed in North America, and holly and mistletoe are widely used for decoration of homes and churches. The European Holly does not grow in the climate of most of the United States, but the American Holly makes an excellent second choice for it closely resembles the European species.

Description Ilex opaca is a medium-sized broadleaved evergreen tree growing to 10–20 m tall, exceptionally up to 30 m tall, with a trunk diameter typically up to 50 cm, exceptionally 120 cm. The bark is light gray, roughened by small warty lumps. The branchlets are stout, green at first and covered with rusty down, later smooth and brown. The winter buds are brown, short, obtuse or acute. The leaves are alternate, 5–7.5 cm long and 2–4 cm broad, stiff, yellow green and dull matte to sub-shiny above (distinctly less glossy than the otherwise fairly similar European Holly Ilex aquifolium[2]), often pale yellow beneath; the edges are curved into several sharp, spike-like points, and a wedge-shaped base and acute apex; the midrib is prominent and depressed, the primary veins conspicuous; the petiole is short, stout, grooved, thickened at base, with a pair of minute stipules. The leaves remain on the branches for two to three years, finally falling in the spring when pushed off by growing buds The flowers are greenish white, small, borne in late spring in short pedunculate cymes from the axils of young leaves or scattered along the base of young branches. The calyx is small, four-lobed, imbricate in the bud, acute, margins ciliate, persistent. The corolla is white, with four petal-like lobes united at the base, obtuse, spreading, hypogynous, imbricate in bud. The flower stem is hairy with a minute bract at base. Like all hollies, it is dioecious, with separate male and female plants; only female plants produce the characteristic red berries. One male can pollenize several females. Male flowers have four stamens, inserted on the base of the corolla, alternate with its lobes; filaments awl-shaped, exserted in the sterile, much shorter in the sterile flower; anthers attached at the back, oblong, introrse, two-celled, cells opening longitudinally.

It is abundant further south on the southern coast and in the Gulf states, reaching its greatest size on the bottomlands of southern Arkansas and eastern Texas. The branches are short and slender. The roots are thick and fleshy. It will grow in both dry and swampy soil, but grows slowly.[1][4] Ilex opaca var. arenicola, or scrub holly, is found as a shrub component in xeric scrub habitats of the Florida peninsula. The flowers are pollinated by insects, including bees, wasps, ants, and night-flying moths. The berries are reputedly poisonous to humans, but are important survival food for birds, who will eat the berries after other food sources are exhausted. The tree also forms a thick canopy which offers protection for birds from predators and storms. Songbirds including thrushes, mockingbirds, catbirds, bluebirds and thrashers frequently feed on the berries Cultivation and uses The wood is very pale, tough, close-grained, takes a good polish, and is used for whip-handles, engraving blocks, and cabinet work. It can also be dyed and used as a substitute for ebony. It has a density 0.58 to 0.64. The sap is watery, and contains a bitter substance which possesses tonic properties Ornamental plant Ilex opaca is often cultivated by plant nurseries for use as a broadleaf evergreen ornamental plant, planted as a shrub or slower growing ornamental tree. Over 1,000 cultivars have been selected, including plants selected for cold tolerance ('Cobalt', a male cultivar, is able to tolerate temperatures as low as −32 °C), growth form (e.g. dwarf forms such as 'Cardinal Hedge', a female plant growing to 1.2 m tall), and color and abundance of fruit (notable female cultivars including the large-berried 'Yule', and the yellow-berried 'Canary' and 'Morgan Gold') Holiday decoration Holly is a popular winter Christmas and holiday season decoration. In English poetry and English stories the Holly is inseparably connected with the merry-making and greetings which gather around the Christmas time. The custom is followed in North America, and holly and mistletoe are widely used for decoration of homes and churches. The European Holly does not grow in the climate of most of the United States, but the American Holly makes an excellent second choice for it closely resembles the European species. The leaves are similar in outline and toothed and bristled very much the same way, but they are a paler green and the surface gloss is duller than in the European species. American holly is the state tree of Delaware." id="7263475224" latitude="0" license="3" longitude="0" nbComments="0" rank="76" tags="redberries cultivarplants ornamentalplants americasouthernplants nikon nikoncoolpix americaplants texasplants wacoplants fruitplants americanholly aquifoliaceae Taxonomy:binomial=ilexopaca" title="American Holly, Ilex opaca ....#8" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/8165/7263475224_1c443c56e2_b.jpg" username="Vietnam Plants &amp; The USA. plants" views="57" />

Edgar Hoover, former Director of the FBI...for many years after his death a FBI agent was assigned to sit in his auto in front of this site in order to keep anyone who wished to damage it away. FBI Director, J Edgar Hoover had the same lunch of buttered toast, cottage cheese and grapefruit, salad and chicken soup at the same table everyday for 20 years at the Mayflower Hotel on Connecticut Ave. NW John Edgar Hoover (January 1, 1895 – May 2, 1972) was the founder of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in its present form and its director from May 10, 1924 until his death in 1972. Hoover was appointed acting director of the FBI by President Coolidge to reform and clean up the bureau, which was considered a haven of corruption. During his tenure, Hoover attained extraordinary power and unusual discretionary authority, while also feuding with many adversaries. Some of his contemporary detractors and now some historians suspect or accused him of having links to the Mafia, of gathering information for the purposes of blackmail, of being a closet homosexual, and of passing as white while persecuting others with similar preferences and family history. To date, J. Edgar Hoover is the longest-serving leader of an executive branch agency in the United States, having served under a record eight presidents, from Calvin Coolidge to Richard Nixon; indeed, it is because of Hoover that, since his tenure, FBI Directors have been limited to ten-year terms. Hoover is credited with creating an effective law enforcement organization, but has frequently been accused of exceeding and abusing his authority in blackmailing notable public figures and engaging in unwarranted political persecution. Hoover's COINTELPRO program allowed FBI agents to disrupt organizations such as the Black Panther Party, the Ku Klux Klan, and Martin Luther King Jr.'s SCLC, using methods including infiltration, legal harassment, and violence. Hoover habitually fired FBI agents, either randomly or by singling out those who &amp;quot;looked like truck drivers&amp;quot; or had &amp;quot;pointy heads.&amp;quot; He was also notorious for assigning agents who had displeased him to career-ending jobs in cities with little need for an FBI presence. Despite this, Hoover was also known to be a supporter of civil rights and liberties on several occasions, most notably was his vocal opposition to the mass internment of Japanese-Americans that took place during World War II. Nevertheless, in 1966, he received the Distinguished Achievement Award from President Lyndon Johnson for his role as Director of the FBI. Hoover was born in Washington, DC, but few details are known of his early years; a birth certificate for him was not filed until 1938. What little is known about his upbringing generally can be traced back to a single 1937 profile by journalist Jack Alexander. Hoover was educated at George Washington University, graduating in 1917 with a law degree. During his time there, he became a member of Kappa Alpha Order (Alpha Nu 1914). While a law student at GWU, Hoover became interested in the career of Anthony Comstock, the New York City based U.S. Postal Inspector who waged prolonged campaigns against fraud and vice a generation earlier. He is thought to have studied Comstock's methods and modeled his early career on Comstock's reputation for relentless pursuit and occasional short cuts in crime fighting. He was awarded an honorary Sc. D by Kalamazoo College in 1937. Rather than enlisting for military service during World War I, he found work with the Justice Department. He soon proved himself capable and was promoted to head the Enemy Aliens Registration Section. In 1919, he became head of the new General Intelligence Division of the Justice Department (see the Palmer Raids). From there, in 1921, he joined the Bureau of Investigation as deputy head, and in 1924 the Attorney General made him the acting director. He became the permanent director of the Bureau in 1925. When Hoover took over the Bureau of Investigation, it had approximately 650 employees, including 441 Special Agents. In great part due to several highly-publicized captures or shootings of outlaws and bankrobbers like John Dillinger, Alvin Karpis and Machine Gun Kelly the Bureau's powers were broadened and it was renamed the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1935. In 1939, the FBI became pre-eminent in the field of domestic intelligence. Hoover made changes such as expanding and combining fingerprint files in the Identification Division to compile the largest collection of fingerprints ever made. Hoover also helped to greatly expand the FBI's recruitment and create the FBI Laboratory, a division established in 1932 to examine evidence found by the FBI. Hoover in 1935Hoover was noted for his concern about—some would say obsession with—subversion. He attacked and spied upon scores of suspected subversives and radicals throughout his career as FBI director. Hoover tended to exaggerate the dangers of subversives, and many believe he overstepped his bounds in his pursuit of eliminating this perceived threat. The one exception to this is perhaps during World War II, when German U-boats would prowl the eastern seaboard of the United States, sinking merchant vessels and some even launching small groups of Nazi agents ashore to cause acts of sabotage within the country. Numerous members of these teams were apprehended due to the increased vigilance and intelligence gathering efforts of the FBI. President Truman wrote in his memoirs: &amp;quot;The country had reason to be proud of and have confidence in our security agencies. They had kept us almost totally free of sabotage and espionage during the World War II&amp;quot;. An example was his capture of the Nazi saboteurs in the Quirin affair. Another example of Hoover's power and obsession with subversion is his handling of the Venona Project. The FBI inherited a pre-WW II joint project with the British to eavesdrop on Soviet spies in the UK and the U.S. Hoover kept the intercepts in a locked safe in his office, choosing not to inform President Harry Truman, his Attorney General McGraith and two Secretaries of State Dean Acheson and General George Marshall while they held office. He chose not to inform the CIA until 1952 of the Venona Project. Hoover amassed significant power by collecting files containing large amounts of compromising and potentially embarrassing information on scores of powerful people, especially politicians. According to Laurence Silberman, appointed deputy Attorney General in early 1974, Clarence Kelly, the then Director of the Bureau, thought they either didn't exist or had been destroyed. After The Washington Post broke a story in January 1975, Kelly searched and found them in his outer office. The House Judiciary Committee then demanded that Silberman testify about those files, which he did. In the 1950s, evidence of Hoover's apparently cozy relations with the Mafia became grist for the media and his many detractors, after famed muckraker Jack Anderson exposed the immense scope of the Mafia's organized crime network, a threat Hoover had long downplayed. Hoover's retaliation and continual harassment of Anderson lasted into the 1970s. Hoover has also been accused of trying to undermine the reputations of members of the civil rights movement and the Black Panther Party. Presidents Harry Truman, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson each considered firing Hoover, but concluded that the political cost of doing so would be too great. Hoover maintained strong support in Congress until his death, whereupon operational command of the Bureau passed to Associate Director Mark Felt. Soon thereafter Nixon appointed L. Patrick Gray, a Justice Department official with no FBI experience, as Acting Director with Felt remaining as Associate Director. As a historical note, Felt was revealed in 2005 to have been the legendary &amp;quot;Deep Throat&amp;quot; during the Watergate scandal. Some of the people whom Deep Throat's revelations helped put in prison—such as Nixon's chief counsel Chuck Colson and G. Gordon Liddy—contend that this was, at least in part, due to Felt's being passed over by Nixon as head of the FBI after Hoover's death in 1972. The FBI Headquarters in Washington, D.C. is named after Hoover. Due to the controversial nature of Hoover's legacy, there have been periodic proposals to rename it. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and Associate FBI Director Clyde Tolson.Speculation and rumors that Hoover was a homosexual have been suggested. However, there is no concrete evidence of these claims so they are mostly based upon speculation. The allegation that he was also a crossdresser is generally considered to be an urban legend. Hoover's right-hand man, Clyde Tolson, was a constant companion for more than 40 years, and they often vacationed together. Hoover and Tolson were both lifelong bachelors, and Hoover lived with his mother until her death in 1938, when he was 43 years old. Hoover was raised a devout Presbyterian and considered the ministry as a career. Some critics said he used this to try to render his personal conduct (sexual or otherwise) above reproach during his tenure at the FBI. Even within Hoover's own lifetime, journalists and other observers made observations that hinted at a hidden personal life. Walter Winchell, the famed gossip columnist, once wrote a column that superficially extolled Hoover, while at the same time included many of the aforementioned peculiarities. A female journalist (in an article cited by Winchell), who managed to talk her way into an interview with Hoover, wrote an article sarcastically entitled, &amp;quot;Hoover: He Always Gets his Man, But he Never Found a Woman.&amp;quot; It has long been rumored that the New Orleans and Chicago Mafia blackmailed Hoover with photos of him in drag and performing homosexual acts, which may partially explain why he allegedly never went after them (these were detailed by journalist Anthony Summers), but according to sources in the Mafia, no such photos existed. After Hoover was ordered to go after the Mafia, other sources claim, he pursued them zealously. However, Peter Maas, a notable journalist, has criticized accusations that Hoover had deep ties with the Kennedy family, and these allegations in turn were heavily criticized in Anthony Summers's book on Marilyn Monroe. An FBI memorandum dated June 11, 1943, reports on a woman spreading gossip of Hoover being &amp;quot;queer&amp;quot; and keeping &amp;quot;a large group of young boys around him.&amp;quot; The memo reports the woman said she had overheard conversation at an adjoining restaurant in Baltimore in 1941. Author Anthony Summers, in researching his book Official and Confidential, interviewed writer Gore Vidal, who grew up in Washington, D.C. in the 1930s. Hoover was becoming famous, Vidal told Summers, and it was always said of him--in my family and around the city--that he was mulatto. People said he came from a family that had `passed.' It was the word they used for people of black origin who, after generations of inbreeding, have enough white blood to pass themselves off as white. That's what was always said about Hoover. African-American author Millie McGhee claims to be related to J. Edgar Hoover in her book Secrets Uncovered. She was told stories during her childhood. One was that J. Edgar himself was not the son of Dickerson N. Hoover of Washington, as officially reported, but actually the son of one Ivy (Ivery) Hoover, and was born in the South, probably New Orleans, and then taken to Washington, D.C. at a very young age and raised by the Hoovers in Washington." id="87128299" latitude="0" license="4" longitude="0" nbComments="2" rank="79" tags="" title="J.

From 1955 to 1957, he served as Mayor of Cincinnati, Ohio. Like other members of his family, Taft was a Republican for the purposes of state-wide elections. However, when running for municipal office in Cincinnati, Taft was a member of the Charter Party. During his term as mayor, Fortune magazine ranked Cincinnati as the best managed big city in the United States. As mayor, he gained the nickname &amp;quot;Mr. Cincinnati&amp;quot;. Charles Phelps Taft was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, and was the son of President William Howard Taft and First Lady Helen Herron Taft, and the younger brother of U.S. Senator Robert Taft, and Bryn Mawr College professor Helen Taft Manning. He was named after his uncle, U.S. Congressman Charles Phelps Taft. He was only 11 years old when he moved to the White House, upon his father's election as President. During his father's tenure as Secretary of War, he was a frequent playmate of President Theodore Roosevelt's children. He dropped out of Yale University in order to serve in the United States Army during World War I and later returned to graduate in 1918, and then earned his law degree from Yale Law School in 1921. He was a 1918 initiate into the Skull and Bones Society. Taft married Eleanor Kellogg Chase on October 6, 1917 in Waterbury, Connecticut. They had five daughters, Eleanor Kellogg Taft, Sylvia Howard Taft, Lucia Chase Taft, Cynthia Herron Taft, Rosalyn Rawson Taft, and two sons, Seth Chase Taft and Peter Rawson Taft III. In 1926, he and his brother Robert Taft helped form the Cincinnati law firm Taft, Stettinius, and Hollister. He was an avid fan of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team and sometimes listened to games on the radio with an earplug during city council meetings. In addition, he was an avid fisherman whose trademark was a canoe tied to his car in anticipation of his next fishing trip. When he died, the epitaph &amp;quot;Gone fishing&amp;quot; was inscribed on his grave at Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati.

Into the life lived by this good citizen between the dates mentioned, were crowded many stirring events, and many hardships, but also much happiness and pleasure. He was a very special man, brave and generous, hopeful and energetic. His parents died while he was still young and early in life he was forced to care for himself. In 1863, when only 17 years of age, he enlisted in the union army being a member of Co. B, Seventy-second New York Infantry, and he served faithfully and well for two years and four months. At the close of the war he was mustered out with his regiment and immediately entered the railway service, an occupation he followed the remainder of his life. He served his apprenticeship on the New York Central. After that he went west to Illinois and for a number of years he worked in the state on the Chicago &amp;amp; Alton. In 1869, he came to Kansas and entered the service of the Frisco, then being constructed through this part of Kansas, and has stayed with the company ever since—twenty years. Shortly after beginning work on this road he met Miss Mary Beecher and becoming enamored of her, secured her consent and they were married in Greenwood county in 1884. They took up their residence in Neodesha and have lived here since with the exception of a few years spent in Anthony. They have had five children to bless their wedded life.

Pages 709-711 EDWARD E. HOSKINS--The late Edward Everett Hoskins, of Neodesha, was one of the old coterie of railroad men as well as a descendant of one of the old American families. He was eight generations removed from the original William Hoskins, the Englishman, who settled in Massachusetts in 1645 and whose posterity found its way westward into Connecticut, Vermont, and into New York which last state it seems to have reached as a pioneer and from which the father of our subject migrated into Venango county, Pennsylvania. William Hoskins, the great-grandfather of our subject, with two brothers, took a prominent part in the war for American independence, being a general and a man of much influence and power in his colony. Edward E. Hoskins was born in Venango county, Pennsylvania, September 14, 1845, and was a son of Samuel A. and Coricandia P. (Powell) Hoskins, both native of New York state. They were married in Jamestown, New York, October 24, 1844, and went immediately into Pennsylvania. Samuel A. Hoskins was a grocer and while life was full of hope and promise he was cut down in early life, dying August 12, 1847, at twenty-four years of age. His wife survived him and died December 14, 1860, at thirty-nine years of age. They were consistent members of the Presbyterian church. Our subject was the only child of his parents. He was shorn of parental guardianship at the age of fifteen and from thence forward his life lay along lines self-chosen for his guidance. He was educated in an Episcopal academy at Paynesville, Ohio, leaving school at the age of seventeen and going to Jamestown, New York, where he enlisted in Company B, 72nd New York volunteer infantry. He joined his regiment at Spotsylvania Court House and immediately went into the battle of the Wilderness without any sort of priliminary training or instruction. He took part in all the fighting done by the Army of the Potomac from that on to the close of the war, including the final act at the surrender of Lee's army at Appomatox. His service covered a period of two years and four months, about as severe and dangerous as any ever experienced, and yet he escaped without wounds or capture. After the grand review at Washington he returned to the place of his enlistment and soon thereafter entered civil pursuits. Railroading seemed to promise much in the way of opportunities and remuneration just after the war and into this service Mr. Hoskins went. He became a brakeman on the New York Central for two years when, gaining his majority, he went to Kankakee county, Illinois, and with his legacy, bought farm land and cultivated it for three years. But the life of a farmer was too slow and plodding for him and he returned to the road. He secured employment with the Chicago, Alton and St. Louis railroad and worked his way up through all the stations from brakeman to passenger conductor. In 1878 he left this company and, going to the Rocky Mountains, he employed with the Colorado Central as conductor but remained only a short time, joining the Santa Fe company and returning east into Kansas in 1879. December 1, of the year 1880 he left the A. T. &amp;amp; S. F. company and joined the St. Louis and San Francisco company, locating in Neodesha. He started at the bottom rung of the ladder, as a brakeman, and January 1, 1884, when he was promoted to a passenger run on the Beaumont branch and he removed his family to Anthony, Kansas, where he remained for a period of five years, when this branch road was discontinued and he returned to Neodesha and went on the main line as a freight conductor and was so employed up to the time of his death. He died suddently from a stroke of apoplexy at his home on the morning of August 9, 1899, and was buried under the auspices of the several Masonic bodies of which he was a member. With the close of life of Edward Everett Hoskins ended also a remarkable career of nearly thirty-five years in railroad work. He witness almost the entire growth of this department of industry, for railroading up to 1865 had not made the great strides in development that have been made since; it was only in its infancy. The equipment of forty years ago was only a temporary makeshift, as compared with that of the twentieth century, and would be totally inadequate to the demands of any line of the present day. As a soldier and civilian many stirring events were crowded into the life of our subject. Many hardships faced him along the journey but, in the main, the span of his life was an era of contentment; happiness and pleasure. He possessed many social qualities was generous, hopeful and energetic. He was frank and impulsive, always ready to aid or command a friend. He was popular with employees and associates and was always found competent to perform any duty required of him. Mr. Hoskins was married in Greenwood county, Kansas, June 26, 1881, to Miss Mary Beecher, of New York state, and a daughter of Jess and Harriet (Hickmott) Beecher, who were married in Maidstone, England. Mr. Beecher was a soldier in our civil war, enlisting in the 112th New York volunteer infantry, in 1862. He was in the Army of the Potomac and was in twenty-one battles of the war. He died in the hospital at Wilmington, North Carolina, April 24, 1865, and is buried at that place in the National cemetery. Mr. and Mrs. Beecher were married November 29, 1848, and were the parents of eleven children of whom Mrs. Hoskins is the youngest, being born in the village of Sherman, New York, April 21, 1863, and the only child born in America. She is in through accord with the American idea, believing in equal priviledges to all who desire to promote the best interests of our common country. Unto Mr. and Mrs. Hoskins were born five children.

<photo  date_taken="2006-12-23 17:21:50" description="This monumental flagstaff commemorates the Dutch establishment of New Amsterdam and the seventeenth century European settlement which launched the modern metropolis of New York City. Designed by H.A.van den Eijnde (1869-1939), a sculptor from Haarlem in the Netherlands, it was dedicated on St. Nicholas Day, December 6, 1926 to mark the tercentenary of Dutch settlement, and the purchase of the island of Manhattan from Native Americans. At that time it stood south of Castle Clinton, then the site of the New York Aquarium. In 1939 the monument underwent restoration and the inscriptions were recut. Subsequently, a fire caused damage to the monument. When the park was closed from 1940 to 1952 for renovations and to build the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, the monument was relocated to its present site at the northeast entrance. In 1609, the Dutch East India Company ship De Halve Maen (The Half Moon) entered the harbor. The river still carries the name of the ship’s commander, an Englishman named Henry Hudson. Subsequent trading missions led to the formation in 1614 of the New Netherland Company which stretched from Delaware to Connecticut. In 1621, the States General of the Netherlands established the Dutch West India Company. Around this time, Dutch and Walloon families formed a small community at the southern end of the island, though the precise date and circumstances of New Amsterdam’s creation remain the subject of debate. Also in question is the location of the almost mythical purchase of the land now known as Manhattan by Dutch provincial Director General Peter Minuit from the Lenape people, an event depicted on the south-west façade of the monument. New Amsterdam grew in size and prosperity over the ensuing decades, and became its own municipality in 1653—the same year that a fortification wall was built between the Hudson and East Rivers at what is now Wall Street. This wall was built to defend against an invasion from New England during the First Anglo-Dutch war. Opposite today’s monument site, and the present-day location of the National Museum of the American Indian (formerly the Old Custom House), stood Fort Amsterdam. The waters of the harbor lapped at a shoreline, which has been extended repeatedly over the past three centuries. New Amsterdam was surrendered to the British in 1664 and renamed New York. Though comprising about .003% of the citizenry, the Dutch have had far-reaching influence on local culture. Two boroughs—the Bronx and Brooklyn (Breuckelen)—numerous streets, and the New York Knickerbockers professional basketball team derive their names from the Dutch. Old Dutch-style Houses such as the Dyckman Farmhouse (circa 1785) in northern Manhattan and the Wyckoff House (circa 1652) in Flatbush, Brooklyn survive a bygone era. Monuments to the Dutch legacy dot the landscape, and include Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney’s statue of Dutch director general &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/508706529/&quot;&gt;Peter Stuyvesant&lt;/a&gt; commissioned for the 1939 New York World’s Fair, which has stood on the western side of Stuyvesant Square Park since 1941. Above all, New York City’s preeminence in commerce is a direct outgrowth of its origins as a Dutch mercantile trading outpost." id="332155554" latitude="40.704359" license="3" longitude="-74.014833" nbComments="1" rank="83" tags="newyorkcity nyc manhattan gothamist downtown batterypark park flagpole netherlandsmemorial netherlands newamsterdam flagstaff dutch ny newyork" title="NYC - Battery Park: Netherlands Memorial Flagstaff" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/134/332155554_a46c4ff73f_b.jpg" username="wallyg" views="1748" />

<photo  date_taken="2009-02-04 21:10:06" description="Co. G, 11th KS. Cavalry William Cutler wrote the following about this gentleman: CAPTAIN A. C. PIERCE, dealer in real estate, loan and insurance agent, first located in Saline County, Kan., in 1856, and afterwards removed to Kansas Falls and engaged in surveying and locating settlers. He moved to Junction City in 1860, and was elected County Assessor in the same spring, and took the census of Davis, Clay and part of Riley counties. He enlisted in Company G, Eleventh Regiment Kansas Volunteer Infantry, as second lieutenant; promoted to first lieutenant; was subsequently changed to cavalry; participated in the battles of Fort Wayne, Indian Territory; Cane Hill, Ark., and Prairie Grove; Price's raid, Independence, Mo.; Big Blue, Fort Scott and the battle on the line, near Kansas City. He was mustered out as captain of his company at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., in August, 1865, when he returned to Junction City. He was married in May, 1865, to Miss Harriet L. Bowen, of Otsego County, N. Y. He was born in the latter county, September 13, 1835, and was educated in Cooperstown, N. Y. They have seven children--Alfred B., Mary, Harriott, Madge, Levi Benjamin, Marcia and Maude. He is a member of the Universalist Church and I. O. G., Junction City; served a term in Kansas City Legislature in 1861, 1862 and 1868; was re-elected in the fall of 1880. He was been County Surveyor, County Clerk and Register of Deeds. Pages 864-867 from volume III, part 2 of Kansas: a cyclopedia of state history, embracing events, institutions, industries, counties, cities, towns, prominent persons, etc. ... / with a supplementary volume devoted to selected personal history and reminiscence. Standard Pub. Co. Chicago : 1912. Alfred Clark Pierce.—The semi-centenary of Kansas's statehood concludes an epoch in her history wherein were developed men, who, from the standpoint of constructive, initiative, and executive talent, rank with the most forceful in the annals of her sister commonwealths. Among those who have realized a large and substantial success, a citizen who has the distinction of having been for fifty-six years a Kansan, one who has been a potential force in practically every phase of her development, is he whose name initiates this article. Coming to Kansas in 1856, he took an active part during the formative period in the settlement of what is now Geary, Dickinson, and Saline counties. His labors in the cause of temperance, while a member of the legislature, would prove sufficient to give precedence and reputation to any man, were this to represent the sum total of his efforts; but Captain Pierce is a man of broad mental ken, strong initiative, and distinct individuality, and he has been a most potent, though unostentatious factor in the commercial, social, and religious life of Geary county, where he took up his residence, in 1860. Alfred C. Pierce was born at Cooperstown, Otsego county, New York, Sept. 13, 1835, son of Benjamin and Polly (Bowen) Pierce. His ancestors on both sides were among the early settlers of America, and numbered among them are men who achieved distinction in the frontier life of those early days, in the commercial era which followed, in the French and Indian wars, and later in the war of the Revolution. The Pierce family became established in America early in the Seventeenth century, when one of the name settled in Rhode Island and married there. His youngest son, John Pierce, married and had five sons, the youngest of whom, Mial Pierce, born in the town of Dover, Dutchess county, New York, in May, 1766, married Isabel Chase, of Pittstown, Rensselaer county, New York, and this couple were the grandparents of Alfred C. Pierce. They had thirteen children, two of whom died young, and the youngest, Benjamin, was the father of Alfred C. He was born on Sept. 30, 1804, and married Polly Bowen, of Middlefield, Otsego county, New York, born Sept. 29, 1808. The Bowen family was founded in America by Griffith Bowen, who came from Langerrith, Wales, in 1638, and settled at Roxbury, Mass. A brother, Lieut. Henry Bowen, followed soon afterward and also settled in Roxbury, where he married a daughter of Isaac Johnson. He fought in the Indian wars of his time, in Isaac Johnson's company, and later became one of the promoters of the Connecticut colony. The line of descent from Lieut. Henry Bowen to Alfred C. Pierce is as follows: Isaac, son of Henry Bowen, was born in Roxbury, Mass., April 20, 1676, and died Jan. 1, 1727; Henry, son of Isaac, was born at Farmington, Mass., June 30, 1700, and died at Woodstock, Conn., Jan. 1, 1758; his son, Silas, was born at Woodstock, Conn., April 17, 1722, and died Feb. 16, 1790; Henry, son of Silas, was born at Eastport, Conn., March 9, 1749, and died Dec. 8, 1830, and his son, Henry, known as &amp;quot;Deacon Henry,&amp;quot; was born Sept. 10, 1780, and settled in Otsego county, New York, where he became an influential farmer. He was the father of Polly Bowen, who married Benjamin Pierce and became the mother of Alfred C. The Bowen family has furnished men who have attained to positions of prominence in the civil, professional, and political life of the country, as well as members who served in the war of the Revolution. Benjamin and Polly (Bowen) Pierce were the parents of thirteen children: Cynthia Ann, born Sept. 25, 1827; Laura Elvira, born March 8, 1829; Henry Bowen, born Sept. 10, 1830; Sabrina M., born Dec. 25, 1831; Horace Milton, born Jan. 5, 1834; Alfred Clark, born Sept. 13, 1835; Elmer Wood, born Nov. 2, 1837; Ellen, born July 29, 1839; Marcia, born May 1, 1841; Silas E., born Jan. 11, 1844; Arthur S., born Feb. 28, 1846; Amy L., born May 5, 1848, and Sumner W., born May 24, 1851 . Alfred Clark Pierce was reared on a farm near Cooperstown, N. Y. His education was acquired in the Cooperstown Academy, supplemented by a course of two terms at the State Normal School, at Albany, N. Y., which course he completed in 1855. He took a keen interest in the problems then confronting the nation, particularly those concerning the future of Kansas. Deciding to join the free-state party, he began his journey to the territory, stopping for a time at Adrian, Mich., with an uncle, Lucien Bowen, who secured a school for him and he taught one term. Continuing westward, he reached Iowa City, where he remained for three weeks. Here he became acquainted with the late Preston B. Plumb, and a friendship was formed which remained unbroken up to the time of Senator Plumb's death. Mr. Pierce, Mr. Plumb, and a party of eight others, left Iowa City, Sept. 3, 1855, conveying 250 Sharp's rifles, a supply of ammunition, and a small brass cannon, intrusted to them for delivery to the Free-Soil party in Kansas. The rifles and ammunition were turned over at Tabor, Iowa, and the cannon was taken on to a point near Topeka, where it was concealed in the woods. On the way west, the party divided at Manhattan, Mr. Plumb following the valley of the Smoky Hill, westward, and Mr. Pierce going up the Blue river. They rejoined each other at Chapman, whence Mr. Plumb returned to Lawrence and Mr. Pierce went on west and located a claim, on which has since been built the city of Salina. There, with seven companions, he erected a log house, the first building of any kind in Saline county, and which he subsequently sold to Colonel Phillips, the founder of Salina. Mr. Pierce abandoned this claim in November, 1855, and went to Ogden, where he was employed in cutting logs. From that time until the spring of 1857 he secured such employment as was offered, working in the district from Junction City to Atchison. Upon the establishment of Kansas Falls by the Massachusetts colony, he became superintendent of building operations for the settlement, and was also engaged in surveying. He also filed on a claim and got out logs and lumber. In 1860 he located permanently at Junction City, where he has since resided, being now the oldest living resident. He was first engaged in surveying, looking up lands and locating settlers. In August, 1862, he enlisted in Company G. Eleventh Kansas infantry, which in 1863 was made the Eleventh Kansas cavalry. He was promoted to first lieutenant, then to captain, and was mustered out with that rank in August, 1865. Returning to Junction City, he was elected county surveyor, later county clerk, and also served as register of deeds. In 1867 he opened the first real estate office in Geary county, later adding to his business insurance and loans. He compiled the first abstract books in the county and added that department to his business. From the start this venture proved a success and the business became the most extensive in the county, as well as one of the most important factors in the development of this section of the state. For forty years Mr. Pierce remained in charge of this business, retiring in 1906, when he was succeeded by his son, Hal Pierce, who is one of the successful men of the county. Owning about 5,000 acres of land in Geary county, Mr. Pierce has, since 1906, been fully occupied in the management of his extensive cattle interests. He is a lifelong Republican and has been an active factor in state, county, and city affairs. He has been three times elected to the state legislature—first in 1861, again in 1867, and the last time in 1879. A consistent and conscientious advocate of temperance and prohibition, he labored unceasingly for the measures which have done so much to place Kansas in the front rank as regards prosperity and citzenship.[sic] On May 9, 1865, Mr. Pierce married Miss Harriet L. Bowen, daughter of Levi H. Bowen, of Cooperstown, N. Y. She died June 2, 1910. Mrs. Pierce was a woman of broad culture and refinement, one who exerted a great influence for good in the social and religious life of Junction City, and one whose charities were many and varied. Her death removed from Geary county one of its noble women, whose loss is keenly felt by a wide circle of friends. Her family lost a mother who believed in her husband, her children, and her fireside, and did her utmost to create an ideal home. Mr. and Mrs. Pierce became the parents of seven children: Alfred Bowen is associated with his father in the cattle business; Mary is the widow of Joseph Gillett, of Purcell, Okla.; Hal (see sketch); Madge is the wife of Frank Smith, of Byers, Okla.; Levi Benjamin is engaged in farming with his father; Marcia resides with her father, and Maud is the wife of Frank Kibby, of Junction City. Captain Pierce is in all respects a high type of the conservative, unassuming American, diligent in his commercial affairs, and conscientious in all things. To do justice to the many phases of his career in an article of this order would be impossible; but in even touching the more salient points there may come objective lessons and incentive, and thus a tribute of appreciation. As a man among men, bearing his due share in connection with the practical activities and responsibilties of a work-a-day world, he has been successful; but over all and above all, he has gained a deep knowledge of the well-springs from which emerge the streams of human motive and action. He has gained a clear apprehension of what life means, what its dominating influences and its possibilities are, and is ever ready to impart to his fellow men the fruits of his investigation, contemplation, and mature wisdom. As an evidence of his progressiveness, it is worthy of mention that he built the first silo in Kansas and was one of the first to use ensilage in feeding cattle. He has known, more or less intimately, every governor of the State of Kansas, and met nearly all the territorial governors. At the age of seventy-six he is a marvel of mental and physical strength and energy, frequently spending a whole day at a time in the saddle, giving his personal attention to his cattle ranches, etc." id="3254059311" latitude="39.014648" license="6" longitude="-96.842422" nbComments="1" rank="85" tags="tombstonephoto civilwarveteran hobby alfredcpierce captaincog11thkscavalry kansas union highlandcemeteryjunctioncitygrearycountykansas biography" title="Alfred C.

Wallace Duncan and Chas. F. Scott. Iola Registers, Printers and Binders, Iola, Kan. JOHN P. DICKEY. JOHN P. DICKEY has been the architect of his own fortunes and has builded wisely and well. His life affords an illustration of the viccisitudes of business under modern conditions; it emphasizes the importance of doing the right thing at the right time and it teaches a lesson of patience under difficulties and perseverance against obstacles,—a lesson that might be profitably followed by many. Mr. Dickey was born in Scott County, Indiana, on the 26th of February, 1824, and is a representative of one of the old families of the South. His father, Rev. John Dickey, was a native of North Carolina, and removed to Kentucky when ten years of age, being there reared to manhood. He was licensed to preach in the Presbytery of that State, and in an early day removed to Indiana, being the first Presbyterian minister ever installed in that commonwealth. He had charge of one church for thirty years and was one of the organizers and founders of the Presbyterian Academy in Hanover, Indiana. As an educator he possessed exceptional ability and throughout his life he devoted his time and talents to imparting knowledge to others or to preaching the gospel, carrying the glad tidings of great joy into many a household upon the frontier. Rev. Dickey preached the first anti-slavery sermon and the first temperance sermon in the synod of Indiana. He was without college education or theological training, like Uncle Tom, of a meek and quiet disposition, yet he was first and foremost in all the reforms of the day. Mr. Beecher was a member of the same synod with Mr. Dickey. Harriet Beecher Stowe says the life of Rev. Mr. Dickey gave her the inspiration for Uncle Tom's Cabin. He was the first installed pastor in the State, and probably the third minister in the State of Indiana. When Birney run on the ticket for anti-slavery Mr. Dickey was the only one who cast a vote for him in Clark County, Indiana. He married Miss Margaret Osborn Steele, a native of Kentucky, and they instilled into the minds of their eleven children lessons of industry, honesty and morality. The father died in 1849 at the age of fifty-nine years, and the mother passed away in 1847, when fifty years of age. Four of the children are yet living, namely: James, a resident of Iola; Mrs. Mary Haines, of New Albany, Indiana; William, now living in Oregon, and John P. of this review. The last named was reared upon his father's farm during the early development of the State of his nativity. His educational privileges were those afforded by the common schools. He learned the carpenter's and wagonmaker's trades as a preparation for life's practical duties, and as a companion and helpmate on life's journey he chose Miss Martha E. Matthews, a native of Kentucky, the wedding being celebrated in New Washington, Indiana. After the death of his first wife he was again married in 1865, his second union being with Miss Amanda D. Dickerson, a native of New York, and a daughter of John Dickerson. Her father was born in the Green Mountain State and when he had arrived at the years of maturity he wedded Miss Mary Bacon, a native of Connecticut. In 1864 they came to Kansas, locating in Geneva, where Mr. Dickerson died in 1856, at the age of seventy-five years, while his wife passed away in 1885, when eighty-five years of age. In their family were six children, three of whom survive, namely: Mrs. Maria L. Williamson, who resides with Mrs. Dickey; Lewis I. Dickerson and Mrs. Dickey. In the year 1857 Mr. Dickey arrived in Kansas, which was then a territory having not yet assumed the dignity of Statehood. He secured a claim on Martin Creek and there resided until his country's call for aid prompted his enlistment as a member of Company D, Ninth Kansas Cavalry. He served for three years along the border of Missouri and Arkansas, escorting trains as they passed to and fro. His command was mostly engaged in guard duty, but occasionally met a band of bushwhackers, which would be followed by a skirmish. At the close of the war the subject of this review returned to his adopted State, locating in Geneva where he was identified with its building interests. He had the honor of building the first school house and the first church ever erected in Allen County, the location being in district No. 1 of Geneva. In 1867 Mr. Dickey removed to his farm and has since carried on agricultural pursuits with marked success. He owns one hundred and sixty acres of rich and arable land and has developed a valuable property. In front of his commodious residence is a wide lawn on which stand beautiful shade trees protecting the home from the hot rays of the summer sun. His extensive barns and outbuildings furnish shelter for grain and stock. When he arrived in Kansas he had only twelve dollars in money, and that served as a nucleus for his present comfortable competence. His success was assured from the beginning because he possesses those qualities which contribute to prosperity. He has always been a staunch advocate of Republican principles, voting with the party since he cast his first ballot for General John C. Fremont. In all life's relations he has been found true to duty, whether it has been in the fields of industrial or agricultural business, in military circles or in the walks of private life. There has been manifest in his career a persistency of purpose that when guided by sound judgment never fails of reward.

<photo  date_taken="2007-08-20 18:13:42" description="Trumbull, with about four hundred twenty students, is one of the smallest and oldest of the twelve undergraduate residential colleges at Yale University. Named for Jonathan Trumbull, the last governor of the Colony of Connecticut and first governor of the State of Connecticut, and a friend and advisor to General George Washington throughout the revolutionary period, it is also one of the most picturesque. A granite fortress, it is emblematic of the Yale design, with Jacobean chimneys, gothic arches and a Norma dining hall. Trumbull was originally two free-standing dormitory buildings flanking the old gymnasium. When university President James Angell instituted the residential college system in 1933, the gym was torn down and the dormitories connected with a new building in the Gothic style, forming the Sterling Quadrangle; the fourth side of the quadrangle is Sterling Memorial Library. The new building contains the Trumbull dining hall, common room, and library, and a new dorm wing was constructed parallel to the originals. A Master's House was also constructed in the northeast corner of the quadrangle. James Gamble Rogers considered the dormitories that would later be incorporated into Trumbull his magnum opus, inscribing the initials of the men who worked on the project on shield carvings along the outside of the buildings. The buildings of Trumbull are modeled after King's College, Cambridge. Three separate courtyards — Alvarez (Main) Court, Potty Court, and Stone Court — grace Trumbull's interior. The college is also home to Nick Chapel, a theater in high demand by Yale students of all colleges. Famous alumni include Anderson cooper (1989), Ron Livingston (1989), Oliver Stone, and Ian McCutheon (1978)." id="1248200877" latitude="41.310412" license="3" longitude="-72.928946" nbComments="2" rank="139" tags="connecticut newhaven ct yaleuniversity yale college campus trumbull trumbullcollege gothic collegiategothic jamesgamblerogers ivyleague ivleague" title="CT - New Haven: Yale University - Trumbull College" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/1366/1248200877_6a54ee5d4c_b.jpg" username="wallyg" views="8586" />
<photo  date_taken="2008-10-12 09:27:32" description="Cracks are Showing (Excerpt on why it's no fun to be in charge of the infrastructure) America’s tradition of bold national projects has dwindled. With the country’s infrastructure crumbling, it is time to revive it THE Mississippi River pushed relentlessly past dozens of levees this month. Towns were submerged, their buildings tiny islands in murky water. Ducks paddled on ponds that had once been farmland. Some flooding was inevitable, given the force of the swollen Mississippi. But a poorly managed flood-defence system did not help. For the past few years it has been hard to ignore America’s crumbling infrastructure, from the devastating breach of New Orleans’s levees after Hurricane Katrina to the collapse of a big bridge in Minneapolis last summer. In 2005 the American Society of Civil Engineers estimated that $1.6 trillion was needed over five years to bring just the existing infrastructure into good repair. This does not account for future needs. By 2020 freight volumes are projected to be 70% greater than in 1998. By 2050 America’s population is expected to reach 420m, 50% more than in 2000. Much of this growth will take place in metropolitan areas, where the infrastructure is already run down. If America does not act, says Robert Yaro of the Regional Plan Association (RPA), a body that plans for the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut region, it will have the infrastructure of a third-world country within a few decades. Economic growth will be constricted, and the quality of life will be diminished. It is not surprising that the floods have put infrastructure in the spotlight, but this time it might remain there. Droughts have shown the need for better long-term planning. Thanks to the soaring oil price, a surge in demand for buses and trains has exposed ageing transport systems in big cities and meagre investment in small ones. And the Highway Trust Fund, which provides most of the federal money for transport projects, will be at least $4 billion in debt next year. The private sector is hungry to invest. In May Morgan Stanley raised $4 billion for its new infrastructure fund, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR), a private-equity firm, launched a global infrastructure practice, and Pennsylvania announced that Citigroup and Abertis, a Spanish toll-road operator, had won an auction to lease the state’s turnpike. Momentum for change exists. Will politicians respond? America has a grand tradition of national planning, from Thomas Jefferson’s vision for roads and canals in 1808, which influenced policy for the next century (and led to America’s first transcontinental railway) to Dwight Eisenhower’s Federal Highway-Aid Act of 1956, which created the interstate system. Such plans stand in stark contrast to the federal government’s strategy today. America invests a mere 2.4% of GDP in infrastructure, compared with 5% in Europe and 9% in China, and the distribution of that money is misguided. The more roads and drivers a state has, the more federal money it receives, explains Judith Rodin of the Rockefeller Foundation, which funds infrastructure research. This discourages states from trying to cut traffic. And because the petrol tax pays for transport projects, if America drives less, there is less money for infrastructure. Even worse is the influence of the pork-barrel. Only around 20 states use cost-benefit analyses to evaluate transport projects; of these, just six do so regularly. Alaska’s “bridge to nowhere” is an infamous result of this sort of planning. But it is not exceptional. Two months after the bridge collapsed in Minneapolis, the Senate approved a transport and housing bill that included money for a stadium in Montana and a museum in Las Vegas. The result is disarray. America’s ageing water infrastructure is sorely underfunded: the Environmental Protection Agency forecasts an $11 billion annual gap in meeting costs over the next 20 years. One heavy storm can cause ageing urban sewerage systems to overflow. Last summer an 83-year-old pipe in Manhattan burst, sending a geyser of steam and debris into the air. Competition for water itself has become vicious. Georgia and Tennessee are in an all-out brawl over it. America’s transport network is similarly dysfunctional, says a recent Urban Land Institute report. Important gateways, such as the ports in Los Angeles and New York, are choked. Flight delays cost at least $15 billion each year in lost productivity. Commutes are more dismal than ever. Congestion on roads costs $78 billion annually in the form of 4.2 billion lost hours and 2.9 billion gallons of wasted petrol, according to the Texas Transportation Institute. Although a growing number of Americans are travelling by train, the railways are old. America’s only “high-speed” train runs between Boston and Washington, DC, on an inadequate track. How can all this be fixed? In January a national commission on transport policy recommended that the government should invest at least $225 billion each year for the next 50 years. The country is spending less than 40% of that amount today. Yet more important than spending lots of money is spending it in better ways. The Brookings Institution, a think-tank, recommends that America focus on metropolitan areas, or “metros”, the top 100 of which account for 65% of population and 75% of economic output. “America 2050”, led by the RPA and a committee of scholars and civic leaders, has a similar scheme for “megaregions”, or networks of metros. The federal government should do what it can to ensure that these areas, first of all, have the infrastructure they need to thrive.

The house was home to Harriet Beecher Stowe prior to her marriage . . . The Beechers lived in Cincinnati for nearly 20 years, from 1832 to the early 1850's, before returning East. Shortly after leaving Cincinnati and basing her writing on her experiences in Cincinnati, in 1851-1852, Harriet Beecher Stowe authored the best-selling book of its time, Uncle Tom's Cabin, a fictionalized popular account of the pain slavery imposed on its victims and of the difficult struggles of slaves to escape and travel, on the Underground Railroad, to freedom in the northern states or Canada. Published just after the draconian fugitive slave laws were enacted by the US Congress in 1850, the book made Harriet Beecher Stowe's name a household word in the United States. Uncle Tom's Cabin has been published in over 75 languages and is still an important text used in schools all over the world. Written at a time when women did not vote, have legal rights, or even speak in public meetings, Uncle Tom's Cabin became an important part of the social fabric and thought . . . &lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/underground/oh1.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.nps.gov/nr/travel/underground/oh1.htm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;In 1832, Harriet Beecher moved from Litchfield, Connecticut, to Cincinnati with her sister and father, a Congregationalist minister who accepted an offer to teach at the Lane Seminary. Harriet and her sister lived with their father in this house, which was provided by the Seminary, and soon after settling in established the Western Female Institute. . . . Marrying Calvin Ellis Stowe, a professor at Lane Seminary, in 1836, Harriet Beecher Stowe moved out of her father's house and into a nearby home in the Walnut Hills area. . . . Stowe witnessed the evils of slavery first-hand while touring the neighboring state of Kentucky and visited the home of abolitionist John Rankin in Ripley, Ohio. During her residency in Ohio, she interviewed several former slaves who had escaped to freedom along the Underground Railroad. Many of the characters in Uncle Tom's Cabin mirrored real-life individuals such as Josiah Henson, a fugitive slave who escaped from Kentucky to Canada via the Underground Railroad with his wife and two children. . . . In 1850, Harriet Beecher Stowe moved from Ohio to Brunswick, Maine, after her husband accepted a teaching position at Bowdoin College. Writing Uncle Tom's Cabin after arriving in Maine, Stowe drew upon her Ohio experiences which inspired her to write the book that would expose the horrors of slavery on a national level.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.harrietbeecherstowecenter.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.harrietbeecherstowecenter.org/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.civilwarwomenblog.com/2011/01/harriet-beecher-stowe.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.civilwarwomenblog.com/2011/01/harriet-beecher-stowe.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;In the summer of 1849, &lt;a href=&quot;http://utc.iath.virginia.edu/interpret/exhibits/tlr1849.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Samuel Charles Stowe&lt;/a&gt;, her 18-month old son died of cholera.

<photo  date_taken="2006-12-23 17:21:41" description="This monumental flagstaff commemorates the Dutch establishment of New Amsterdam and the seventeenth century European settlement which launched the modern metropolis of New York City. Designed by H.A.van den Eijnde (1869-1939), a sculptor from Haarlem in the Netherlands, it was dedicated on St. Nicholas Day, December 6, 1926 to mark the tercentenary of Dutch settlement, and the purchase of the island of Manhattan from Native Americans. At that time it stood south of Castle Clinton, then the site of the New York Aquarium. In 1939 the monument underwent restoration and the inscriptions were recut. Subsequently, a fire caused damage to the monument. When the park was closed from 1940 to 1952 for renovations and to build the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, the monument was relocated to its present site at the northeast entrance. In 1609, the Dutch East India Company ship De Halve Maen (The Half Moon) entered the harbor. The river still carries the name of the ship’s commander, an Englishman named Henry Hudson. Subsequent trading missions led to the formation in 1614 of the New Netherland Company which stretched from Delaware to Connecticut. In 1621, the States General of the Netherlands established the Dutch West India Company. Around this time, Dutch and Walloon families formed a small community at the southern end of the island, though the precise date and circumstances of New Amsterdam’s creation remain the subject of debate. Also in question is the location of the almost mythical purchase of the land now known as Manhattan by Dutch provincial Director General Peter Minuit from the Lenape people, an event depicted on the south-west façade of the monument. New Amsterdam grew in size and prosperity over the ensuing decades, and became its own municipality in 1653—the same year that a fortification wall was built between the Hudson and East Rivers at what is now Wall Street. This wall was built to defend against an invasion from New England during the First Anglo-Dutch war. Opposite today’s monument site, and the present-day location of the National Museum of the American Indian (formerly the Old Custom House), stood Fort Amsterdam. The waters of the harbor lapped at a shoreline, which has been extended repeatedly over the past three centuries. New Amsterdam was surrendered to the British in 1664 and renamed New York. Though comprising about .003% of the citizenry, the Dutch have had far-reaching influence on local culture. Two boroughs—the Bronx and Brooklyn (Breuckelen)—numerous streets, and the New York Knickerbockers professional basketball team derive their names from the Dutch. Old Dutch-style Houses such as the Dyckman Farmhouse (circa 1785) in northern Manhattan and the Wyckoff House (circa 1652) in Flatbush, Brooklyn survive a bygone era. Monuments to the Dutch legacy dot the landscape, and include Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney’s statue of Dutch director general &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/508706529/&quot;&gt;Peter Stuyvesant&lt;/a&gt;, commissioned for the 1939 New York World’s Fair, which has stood on the western side of Stuyvesant Square Park since 1941. Above all, New York City’s preeminence in commerce is a direct outgrowth of its origins as a Dutch mercantile trading outpost." id="332157206" latitude="40.704359" license="3" longitude="-74.014833" nbComments="1" rank="149" tags="newyorkcity nyc manhattan gothamist downtown batterypark park flagpole netherlandsmemorial netherlands newamsterdam flagstaff dutch ny newyork" title="NYC - Battery Park: Netherlands Memorial Flagstaff" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/142/332157206_487fb30c43_b.jpg" username="wallyg" views="2342" />
