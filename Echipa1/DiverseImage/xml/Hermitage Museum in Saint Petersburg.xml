His rise from so obscure a station to the first dignities of the empire, seems to prove that he was a bold and able leader. But his boldness prompted him to aspire to the throne, and his abilities were employed to supplant, not to serve, his indulgent master. The minds of the soldiers were irritated by an artificial scarcity, created by his contrivance in the camp; and the distress of the army was attributed to the youth and incapacity of the prince. It is not in our power to trace the successive steps of the secret conspiracy and open sedition, which were at length fatal to Gordian. Murder of Gordian A.D. 244, March A sepulchral monument was erected to his memory on the spot where he was killed, near the conflux of the Euphrates with the little river Aboras. The fortunate Philip, raised to the empire by the votes of the soldiers, found a ready obedience from the senate and the provinces. &amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ccel.org/ccel/gibbon/decline/files/volume1/chap7.htm#RGN&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.ccel.org/ccel/gibbon/decline/files/volume1/chap7.htm#RGN&lt;/a&gt;" id="4750714659" latitude="0" license="2" longitude="0" nbComments="2" rank="120" tags="roman fisheye hermitage hermitagemuseum saintpetersburg russia sculpture toyfisheye" title="Philip the Arab" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/4099/4750714659_9566215147_b.jpg" username="seriykotik1970" views="173" />
