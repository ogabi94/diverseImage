The statue is a work of Sir Richard Westmacott, the 123-feet-high column was designed by Benjamin Wyatt, funds for the statue were raised by stopping one day's pay from every soldier in the late Duke's army; the memorial was erected in 1883. The late Duke was the second son of George III, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army between 1795-1809 and 1811-1827, respectively. The column also involves a viewing platform on the upper part, but it was closed after a series of suicides at the early 20th century." id="2339456603" latitude="51.505764" license="3" longitude="-0.131256" nbComments="2" rank="24" tags="london statue statuary themall westmacott sirrichardwestmacott benjaminwyatt" title="Duke of York Column" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/3088/2339456603_5c89570848_b.jpg" username="Istvan" views="70" />

<photo  date_taken="2006-11-10 06:24:10" description="The Monument to the Great Fire of London, more commonly known as The Monument is a 61-metre (202-foot) tall stone Roman doric column. It is located at the junction of Monument Street and Fish Street Hill, 61 metres from where the Great Fire of London started in 1666. It consists of a large fluted Doric column built of Portland stone topped with a gilded urn of fire, and was designed by Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke. The west side of the base of the Monument displays an emblematical sculpture (pictured here), by Caius Gabriel Cibber, in alto and bas relief, of the destruction of the City; with King Charles II, and his brother, James, the Duke of York (later James II) surrounded by Liberty, Architecture, and Science, giving directions for its restoration. Its 61-metre height marks the monument's distance to the site of Thomas Farynor, the king's baker's shop in Pudding Lane, where the fire began. At the time of construction (between 1671 and 1677) it was the tallest freestanding stone column in the world. It is possible to reach the top of the monument by climbing up the narrow winding staircase of 311 steps. A cage was added in the mid-19th century at the top of the Monument to prevent people jumping off, after six people had committed suicide between 1788 and 1842. Three sides of the base of the monument carry inscriptions in Latin.

It stands at the junction of Monument Street and Fish Street Hill, 202 ft (61.57 metres) from where the Great Fire of London started in 1666. Another monument, the Golden Boy of Pye Corner marks the point near Smithfield where the fire stopped. Monument tube station is named after the monument. Constructed between 1671 and 1677, it is the tallest isolated stone column in the world. The Monument consists of a fluted Doric column built of Portland stone topped with a gilded urn of fire, and was designed by Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke. Its 202 foot (61.57 metre) height marks its distance from the site in Pudding Lane of the shop of Thomas Farynor, the king's baker, where the fire began. The top of the Monument is reached by a narrow winding staircase of 311 steps. A cage was added in the mid-19th century at the top of the Monument to prevent people jumping off, after six people had committed suicide between 1788 and 1842.

Perrin's name appears on the rate books for the house from 1724 to 1740 and his monogramed initials have been wrought into the iron gates.

<photo  date_taken="2011-07-10 02:18:35" description="Frederick Augustus, second son of George III, commander in chief of the Army and The Grand old Duke of York in the famous nursery rhyme, stands on top of a Tuscan column made of Aberdeenshire granite 124 feet high. At the time of building in 1831-34 a popular joke was that he stood so high so as to be out of reach of his creditors; when he died in1827 he was Â£2 million in debt. The whole structure including the 53 square feet of concrete foundations cost Â£25,000 , most of which was raised by stopping the pay of every officer and soldier in the Army for one day. The column was designed by Sir Benjamin Wyatt and the bronze 14 feet statue was sculpted by Sir Richard Westmacott. The column was opened to the public but almost immediately it became a popular venue for suicides. The railings surrounding the square balcony were raised but the suicides found a way and the column was closed to the public in the 1850s. I heard a story that a PC from AD had climbed the spiral staircase to the top in company with a maintenance crew and reported that the staircase was covered with the droppings from generations of pigeons. The building on the right with the awning in Carlton House Terrace is The German Embassy after having been Prussia House since it was built." id="5921573328" latitude="51.506151" license="5" longitude="-0.132308" nbComments="0" rank="64" tags="carltonhouseterrace waterlooplace dukeofyorkcolumn nelsonscolumn germanembassy pedestrians canonrow metropolitan london uk cannonrow" title="Carlton House Terrace" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/6145/5921573328_5dacc21a47_b.jpg" username="Leonard Bentley" views="180" />

<photo  date_taken="2010-06-21 18:25:33" description="Me with the designer of the lift from architects Matthew Lloyd. It works roughly like this: Falling water tanks on either side of the lift raise it (or vice-versa lower it). with solar panels powering the pumps - hence a zero energy product (well, zero fossil fuel energy). The test flight worked so well with me I didn't realise it was happening. It's a lovely idea. It is being showcased here on the steps beneath the Duke of York's column leading down to the Mall as part of the London Festival of Architects &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lfa2010.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.lfa2010.org/&lt;/a&gt;.
