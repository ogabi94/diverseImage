<photo  date_taken="2010-02-25 16:49:09" description="- The Bran Museum is the holder of some valuable and diverse collections of museum objects, some of them belonging to the treasury of the national cultural patrimony. The collections are structured according to the main fields namely history, art history, ethnography, recognized in the thematic of the three departments of the museum: Castle, Medieval Customs Point and The Village Museum form Bran. Of great value is the collection of white weapons and fire arms, underlining the military purpose fulfilled by the Bran Fortress in the Middle Age. Of great importance are also the collections of decorative art (furniture, ceramics and silvery) and fine art (sculpture and wood paintings), having as source the old royal fund, diverse acquisitions and donations. BRAN CASTLE (1377-1920) - The Bran fortress was built on a cliff between Magura and The Hill of the Fortress, its position conferring an outstanding view towards both the hills of Moeciu and the ones from the Land of Bârsa. The building of the fortress was imposed by strategic and economic reasons. The strategic reasons underlined by the expansion of the Ottoman Empire which, by the end of the XIV century, began threatening the south-eastern borders of Transylvania; the economic reasons, given by the fact that the commercial road, one of the most important access ways connecting Transylvania to Wallachia, crossed this area. All these reasons determined the Hungarian king Louis I of Anjou to develop strengthening works of the Bran pass... BRAN CASTLE (1920-1947) - the royal residence - On December 1st 1920, the people from Brasov – through the voice of their mayor, Mr. Karl Schnell – have given the castle as a present to the Romanian royal family, in whose possession the castle remained for the next twenty seven years. After becoming property of the royal family, between 1920 -1930 the castle suffered a series of architectural renovations, aiming to transform it into a modern summer residence. The renovation works were lead by the Czech architect Karel Liman, who also worked at the castles Peles and Pelisor. Two towers for stairs were added, the bulwarks and the shooting gaps became windows, the stoves and the hearths became modern fireplaces. - In order to make it inhabitable by the royal family, the Bran Castle was equipped with all utilities compulsory in a genuine royal residence. The water was supplied by the 57 meters fountain dug in the inner court of the castle. The illumination of the castle was insured by a turbine power station, built by will of Queen Maria in May 1932, to which the communes Bran, Simon and Moeciu were also connected, “poor and strictly Romanian communes, who wouldn’t have had such an advantage in the near future”, as shown by a thanking letter sent to Queen Maria by the inhabitants of the three communes. The turbine – manufactured by the Voith Company – was brought into operation on August 29th, 1932. A water power station of 85 hp was also built on Turcu River in December 1932, to illuminate the castle and the surroundings." id="4387648574" latitude="0" license="3" longitude="0" nbComments="4" rank="10" tags="romania brasov bran moeciu" title="Bran Castle - ROMANIA" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/2792/4387648574_ef9dc5a263_b.jpg" username="ROMANIA 100%" views="317" />

The fortress is situated on the border between Transylvania and Wallachia. The castle is famous because of persistent myths that it was once the home of Vlad the Impaler, a famous or infamous medieval warlord; however, there is no evidence that he ever lived there. According to most accounts, the Impaler spent two days in the Bran dungeon, as the area was occupied by the Ottoman Empire at the time. Because of the disputed connections between Vlad and the fictional character Dracula, the castle is marketed to foreign tourists as Dracula's Castle." id="7706908996" latitude="45.518857" license="5" longitude="25.366058" nbComments="31" rank="17" tags="bran castle dracula queen mary romania building cosmos tour d300 nikon 18200vr 70300mmvr free freepicture archer10 dennis jarvis dennisgjarvis dennisjarvis iamcanadian" title="Romania-1850 - Dracula's Castle (Bran Castle)" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/8023/7706908996_0fe28c69a4_b.jpg" username="archer10 (Dennis)" views="545" />
