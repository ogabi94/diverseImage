The plan was hexagonal, a symbol of the Star of David. The building then rose to a 192-foot spire that supported a cross, symbolizing the emergence of Christianity out of Judaism. Several elements of the design were innovative in church design. The sanctuary was placed in the middle of the building and elevated, symbolizing its importance as the center of the church. Seating was around the hexagonal plan to allow members to relate visually to each other during services. This type of seating arrangement was unusual for a church at the time, but has been employed in many churches since. Saarinen also used lighting to affect the character of the building. For example, the main source of light in the sanctuary was indirect, giving the space a spiritual quality. The landscape of the North Christian Church represents the fusion of Modern architecture and landscape architecture. The church structure hovers over its suburban setting; its tapered hexagonal roof blends with the low berm which surrounds it. The crisply delineated geometric forms of the church enclose a sanctuary in the round focused on a central altar. Light enters from above. Classrooms and offices look outward to the outer landscape sanctuary: the bosque, lawn, and maple alee. Views of the surrounding town are screened by enclosing trees. The spatial organization of the site is an extension of the ordered geometry of the structure; additionally, the landscape design for the church extends a liturgical sequence of spaces into the site which is then included in the celebration of entry into the church. The neutral grays and blacks of the modernist structure are complemented by neutral greens of plantings. Color is changed in the interior space through seasonal programming of altar seat cushions, flowers, and banners.

The plan was hexagonal, a symbol of the Star of David. The building then rose to a 192-foot spire that supported a cross, symbolizing the emergence of Christianity out of Judaism. Several elements of the design were innovative in church design. The sanctuary was placed in the middle of the building and elevated, symbolizing its importance as the center of the church. Seating was around the hexagonal plan to allow members to relate visually to each other during services. This type of seating arrangement was unusual for a church at the time, but has been employed in many churches since. Saarinen also used lighting to affect the character of the building. For example, the main source of light in the sanctuary was indirect, giving the space a spiritual quality. The landscape of the North Christian Church represents the fusion of Modern architecture and landscape architecture.

Infantry Pages 656-658 from volume III, part 1 of Kansas: a cyclopedia of state history, embracing events, institutions, industries, counties, cities, towns, prominent persons, etc. ... / with a supplementary volume devoted to selected personal history and reminiscence. Standard Pub. Co. Chicago : 1912 William Rufus Cowley, lawyer, a citizen of Columbus, Kan., was born at Halbeach, Lincolnshire, England, April 23, 1843. His parents were Joseph J. and Hannah (Hunt) Cowley, unto whom were born, Maria, Abraham, William R., and Hannah, in England and Charlotte, in the United States. The father came to the United States, in 1850, and was followed the next year by his wife and children. They settled at Hudson, Ohio, where the parents spent the rest of their days, the father dying at the age of eighty-two years and the mother at the age of eighty. The father was a blacksmith by trade and also was a merchant. In his latter days he was a local preacher of the Methodist Episcopal church. William Rufus Cowley was eight years of age when he was brought to this country. He grew to manhood in Ohio, in the public schools of which state he obtained the foundation of his education. In Sept., 1860, then seventeen years of age, he went to Iowa. There he taught school in the winter of 1861-2, and then returned to Ohio and entered the high school at Akron, where he was a student when President Lincoln issued his call for volunteers, in the 100-days service. Mr. Cowley answered this call, enlisting as a private in Company C, Eighty-fourth Ohio infantry, in the spring (April) of 1862. He served 20 days and was discharged at Camp Delaware, Ohio. He then returned to Iowa and taught school in the winter of 1862-3, and in April, 1863, entered Christian College at Oskaloosa, Iowa, for the spring and fall terms. In the winter of 1863-4, he again taught school, then reëntered Christian College, where he remained only eighteen days, when he again enlisted in the war, in Company C, Fifteenth Iowa infantry, under Col. W. W. Bellknap, as a private. His command was attached to the Seventeenth army corps and marched from Clifton, Tenn., to Pulaski, Tenn., and thence southward, crossing the Tennessee river at Huntsville, Ala., and joining the main army of General Sherman at Rome, Ga. Mr. Cowley participated in the siege of Atlanta, and his command followed Hood to Snake Creek Gap and became stationed at Marietta, Ga., where, under the Iowa rule, he cast his first presidential vote, voting for Lincoln. His command was with Sherman on his memorable march to the sea. At Savannah, Ga., Mr. Cowley was detailed to act as sergeant-major of the Fifteenth Iowa infantry. The march was continued to Beaufort, S. C., and thence to Columbia. As the approach was made to Columbia, Feb. 17, 1865, the city was seen to be on fire, evidently having been set on fire by Confederates. The march through South and North Carolina was continued. The battle of Smithfield was the last one in which Mr. Cowley took part. The march continued uninterrupted to Richmond. Va., and to Washington, and Mr. Cowley's command took part in the Grand Review at the national capital. It was sent from Washington to Parkersburg, W. Va., and thence by boat to Louisville, Ky., where Mr. Cowley and his comrades were discharged, but they were not finally mustered out of the service until they reached Davenport, Iowa. On Aug. 6, 1865, Mr. Cowley was mustered out as a sergeant. Sept. 5, 1865, found him again in Christian College at Oskaloosa, his purpose being to become a preacher in the Christian church. He attended college and preached until the end of the school year of 1868, and continued to preach until 1870, but meanwhile he had studied law at Montezuma, Iowa, where he was admitted to the bar, in the last named year. He was elected surveyor of Poweshiek county, Iowa, and served as such one term. In January, 1873, he located at Columbus, Kan., and took up the practice of law. In 1878 and in 1880 he was elected county attorney for Cherokee county and served creditably in this office four years. On Aug. 1, 1875, R. A. Long &amp;amp; Company, lumber dealers at Columbus, employed him as their attorney and counsellor. This company was succeeded by the Long-Bell Lumber Company, which was incorporated under the laws of Missouri, April 10, 1884, and Mr. Cowley was continued as attorney and counsellor for the new organization. He had charge of all the legal affairs of the company for thirty-one years and nine months, until April 23, 1907, when, on the anniversary of his sixty-fourth birthday, the Long-Bell Lumber Company retired him upon a stipulated salary for life, doing so at a banquet in the Baltimore Hotel at Kansas City, when, in the presence of 110 guests R. A. Long, on behalf of the company, spoke in terms of highest praise of Mr. Cowley, concluding with presenting him a check for $2,500. Since his retirement from the practice of law Mr. Cowley has given much of his time to preaching for the Christian churches. He has been a member of the Christian church since January, 1859. In politics he has been a Republican. On Nov. 10, 1867, he married Florence J. Smith, who was a classmate with him in college at Oskaloosa, and their children are: William F., Minnie (wife of Senator Charles S. Huffman), Lawrence L. (a graduate in art and law of the University of Kansas and now prosecuting attorney of Noble county, Oklahoma), and Clare J. (also a graduate in art of the University of Kansas and now a salesman for the Long-Bell Lumber Company, with headquarters at Fort Worth, Texas). Mr. Cowley has a beautiful home in Columbus, and it has been the scene of many social functions and happy hours for his family and large circle of friends. In his home he has a private library of many rare and valuable volumes. No man stands higher in the estimation of his fellow citizens than does Mr. Cowley. What he has accomplished in life, and that has been gratifying success, he has done so by means of appliant effort and the improvement of opportunity. He commenced at the bottom rung of the ladder of life and has forged his way upward to an enviable reputation as a lawyer, citizen, and Christian.

<photo  date_taken="2008-07-18 11:07:49" description="Near the main entrance to the cathedral stands the large sarcophagus which supposedly contains the body of Christopher Columbus. His body was brought here from Havana at the end of the 1890s. The sarcophagus of Columbus is carried by four large statues, representing the kingdoms of Aragón, Castille, León and Navarra. The Cathedral of Saint Mary of the See (Spanish: Catedral de Santa María de la Sede), better known as Sevilla Cathedral, is a Roman Catholic cathedral in Sevilla (Andalusia, Spain). It is the largest Gothic cathedral and the third-largest church in the world. It was registered in 1987 by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, along with the Alcázar palace complex and the General Archive of the Indies. After its completion in the early 16th century, Seville Cathedral supplanted Hagia Sophia as the largest cathedral in the world, a title the Byzantine church had held for nearly a thousand years. The cathedral is also the burial site of Christopher Columbus. The Archbishop's Palace is located on the northeastern side of the cathedral. Interior of the cathedral. Seville Cathedral was built to demonstrate the city's wealth, as it had become a major trading center in the years after the Reconquista in 1248. In July 1401 it was decided to build a new cathedral since the structure of the current building, an ancient Muslim mosque which had been converted into a Christian church, was so badly damaged by the 1356 earthquake. According to local oral tradition, the members of the cathedral chapter said: &amp;quot;Let us build a church so beautiful and so great that those who see it built will think we were mad&amp;quot;. Construction began in 1402 and continued until 1506. The clergy of the parish gave half their stipends to pay for architects, artists, stained glass artisans, masons, carvers, craftsman and labourers and other expenses. Five years after construction ended, in 1511, the dome collapsed and work on the cathedral recommenced. The dome again collapsed in 1888, and work was still being performed on the dome until at least 1903. The 1888 collapse occurred due to an earthquake and resulted in the destruction of &amp;quot;every precious object below&amp;quot; the dome at that time. The interior has the longest nave of any cathedral in Spain. The central nave rises to a height of 42 meters and is lavishly decorated with a large quantity of gilding. In the main body of the cathedral, the most noticeable features are the great boxlike choir loft, which fills the central portion of the nave, and the vast Gothic retablo of carved scenes from the life of Christ.

It belonged to the ancient mosque and retains its horseshoe arch shape from that time. In the early 16th century it was adorned with terracotta sculptures by the sculptor Miguel Perrin, highlighting the great relief of the Purification on the entrance arch. The plaster ornaments were made by Bartolomé López. East facade The Door of Sticks or the Adoration of the Magi, decorated with sculptures by Lope Marin in 1548, has a relief of the Adoration of the Magi at the top, executed by Miguel Perrin in 1520. The name Palos or Sticks is due to the wooden railing which separates that area from the rest of the building.

<photo  date_taken="2007-08-05 20:39:32" description="Co. F, 123rd OH. Infantry Neodesha Daily Sun, Thursday, Feb. 22, 1906, Pg. 1 Vol. VII, No. 94 DR. C. W. LONG IS DEAD. ______ Dr. C. W. Long, one of the oldest and wealthiest citizens of Neodesha, died in Kansas City at the home of his sister, Mrs. W. H. Cramer, this morning at 8 o’clock, of a lingering disease with which he had been afflicted several months. After being bedfast here for some weeks he was removed to Kansas City for treatment. He had a bowel or stomach trouble and an affection of the lungs. Mrs. Long and daughter, Mrs. J. F. Kimball, have been in Kansas City by his bedside almost constantly, Mrs. Kimball came back to Neodesha with her husband the first of the week and started for Kansas City again last night. The train was late and her father was dead before she arrived. Funeral arrangements have not been made, further than it is known that the body will arrive here on the morning train tomorrow. Dr. Long came to Neodesha from Ohio thirty-eight years ago. He was then only about thirty years old, possibly less. No exact dates are at hand. The old settlers remember the year he came and that he and J. M. Keck, both young men, bached on their claimed. Dr. Long farmed and practiced medicine ever since and accumulated considerable wealth. He married a daughter of Robert Cole, who survives him with a daughter, the wife of Dr. J. F. Kimball, and a son, Charles, 11 years old. Dr. Long was a consistent member of the Christian church one of its principal supporters—and was a kind hearted good citizen, having no enemies at all. His death is a serious loss to Neodesha. Neodesha Daily Sun, Monday, Feb. 26, 1906, Pg. 1 Vol. VII, No. 97 DR. C. W. LONG. ______ The funeral of Dr. C. W. Long was very largely attended yesterday, and a long procession of vehicles followed the hearse to the cemetery. Elder Lowe of Arkansas City and Elder Tanksley of this city conducted the services, a double quartet from the Christian church doing the singing, assisted by Mrs. Wm. Bartrim of Kansas City. The following sketch was prepared by Dr. D. H. Reed of North Fairfield, Ohio, brother-in-law of Dr. Long, and was read at the funeral by Elder Lowe: Doctor Charles W. Long was born at South Hampton, in the state of Pennsylvania, Sept. 26, 1840. His parents were Abram P. and Catherine Long. The family moved from there to Ohio in 1843 ad settled in Greenwich township, Huron county. There the doctor resided with his parents on the farm until the breaking out of the Civil war. When at the call of his country he enlisted in company E, 123rd Regt. Ohio Vol. Infantry August 25, 1862, and was elected 1st sergeant of his company. The regiment was assigned to Gen. Hunter’s brigade, where the regiment participated in the battles, raids and marches of the famous Shenandoah Valley. In the battle of Winchester he was severely wounded and captured by the confederates. He was afterwards exchanged and participated in the final battles for the capture of Richmond. He was again taken prisoner while defending a bridge on the line of Lee’s retreat, but was released in a few hours by the surrender at Appomattox. He had been promoted to 2nd lieutenancy and was discharged at Columbus, Ohio, on the 12th day of June, 1865, having served three years, two months and nine days. On his return to Huron county he entered the office of Doctor D. H. Reed of North Fairfield, Ohio, where he remained until he was prepared to enter medical college. In 1869 he came to Kansas and settled near the junction of Verdigris and Fall rivers near Neodesha. After the location of the city he commenced the practice of his profession which he followed with zeal and ability until failing health compelled him to desist. On February 17th 1884, he was united in marriage to Miss Dora E. Cole, daughter of William and Ellen Cole. To this union were born two children, Anna Eleanor, wife of Dr. J. F. Kimball, and Charles Cole Long. In April 1886 under the preaching of Elder A. Elmore, he united with the Christian church of Neodesha, where he served acceptably as one of the elders, and by his genial Christian deportment won the esteem, confidence and love of his Christian brethren. As a citizen he was loyal to his neighbors and friends, loving his country and state, discharging his duty relatively to each as he deemed right and just. In his family, who will feel most keenly his loss, he was a kind and faithful husband and a tender and loving father whose memory will ever prove a blessing and guide to those whom he loved so well and lead so tenderly and guarded so assiduously from the ills that beset their earthly pathway. He leaves four sisters, the only surviving members of a family of eight children, who will feel deeply the loss they have all sustained. Dear friends, had it been left to Dr. Charles W. Long this brief biography had not been written. But when Death’s summons came, he would as of old when the bugle sounded the charge to battle have gone forth modestly, silently, “As one who wrapped the drapery of his couch around him and lies down to pleasant dreams.”" id="1023750689" latitude="37.440451" license="6" longitude="-95.687055" nbComments="1" rank="38" tags="hobby civilwarveteran tombstonephoto charleswlong cof123rdohinfantry bornatsouthhamptonpasept261840 kansasvirtualcivilwarveterancemetery neodeshacitycemetery neodeshakansas" title="Charles W.

The plan was hexagonal, a symbol of the Star of David. The building then rose to a 192-foot spire that supported a cross, symbolizing the emergence of Christianity out of Judaism. Several elements of the design were innovative in church design. The sanctuary was placed in the middle of the building and elevated, symbolizing its importance as the center of the church. Seating was around the hexagonal plan to allow members to relate visually to each other during services. This type of seating arrangement was unusual for a church at the time, but has been employed in many churches since. Saarinen also used lighting to affect the character of the building. For example, the main source of light in the sanctuary was indirect, giving the space a spiritual quality. The landscape of the North Christian Church represents the fusion of Modern architecture and landscape architecture. The church structure hovers over its suburban setting; its tapered hexagonal roof blends with the low berm which surrounds it. The crisply delineated geometric forms of the church enclose a sanctuary in the round focused on a central altar. Light enters from above. Classrooms and offices look outward to the outer landscape sanctuary: the bosque, lawn, and maple alee. Views of the surrounding town are screened by enclosing trees. The spatial organization of the site is an extension of the ordered geometry of the structure; additionally, the landscape design for the church extends a liturgical sequence of spaces into the site which is then included in the celebration of entry into the church.

<photo  date_taken="2009-04-21 21:01:23" description="Title : First Christian Church Creator : Saarinen, Eliel; Saarinen, Eero Creator role : Architect Date : 1941 Current location : Columbus, Indiana, United States Description of work : &amp;quot;First Christian Church (1941), originally named Tabernacle Church of Christ, is one of the first Modern religious buildings in America and the first Modern building to be constructed in Columbus. Nationally recognized at the time of its construction, it had an impact on church design in the post-World War II era. First Christian Church was one of two churches designed by the firm of Saarinen and Saarinen, consisting of Eliel Saarinen and his son Eero. Saarinen answered questions about the suitability of a Modern design for a religious building by saying: 'Our forefathers and we ourselves have been using the dead styles of alien cultures. We have combined them in thousands of different ways until the last drop of expressiveness has been squeezed out.' Many believe that First Christian Church is a synthesis of the father's and son's work, and of their independent approaches: Eliel's focus on materials, craft, and relationship of the building to the user; and Eero's Modern aesthetic. In 1941, Time Magazine described the building as, 'the costliest modern church in the world, planned by Europe's most famous modern architect and his son.' Newsweek, in 1942, noted, 'In style, the new Tabernacle is utterly unlike the seventeen other churches in Columbus or, for that matter, in almost any other city in the world.'&amp;quot; (Source: &amp;quot;National Historic Landmarks Program: First Christian Church&amp;quot;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1695315809&amp;amp;ResourceType=Building&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1695315809&amp;amp;R...&lt;/a&gt;, Accessed June 8, 2009) For an exhaustive description of the building, including pertinent history, the architect's biography, and bibliography of evaluative articles, please refer to the National Historic Landmark nomination form submitted for the building available at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nps.gov/history/nhl/designations/samples/in/1stchris.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.nps.gov/history/nhl/designations/samples/in/1stchris.pdf&lt;/a&gt; Description of view : Detail view looking up at the geometrically-designed wooden main entrance doors.

<photo  date_taken="2012-07-13 17:03:43" description="The Cathedral of Saint Mary of the See (Spanish: Catedral de Santa María de la Sede), better known as Sevilla Cathedral, is a Roman Catholic cathedral in Sevilla (Andalusia, Spain). It is the largest Gothic cathedral and the third-largest church in the world. It was registered in 1987 by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, along with the Alcázar palace complex and the General Archive of the Indies. After its completion in the early 16th century, Seville Cathedral supplanted Hagia Sophia as the largest cathedral in the world, a title the Byzantine church had held for nearly a thousand years. The cathedral is also the burial site of Christopher Columbus. The Archbishop's Palace is located on the northeastern side of the cathedral. Interior of the cathedral. Seville Cathedral was built to demonstrate the city's wealth, as it had become a major trading center in the years after the Reconquista in 1248. In July 1401 it was decided to build a new cathedral since the structure of the current building, an ancient Muslim mosque which had been converted into a Christian church, was so badly damaged by the 1356 earthquake. According to local oral tradition, the members of the cathedral chapter said: Let us build a church so beautiful and so great that those who see it built will think we were mad. Construction began in 1402 and continued until 1506. The clergy of the parish gave half their stipends to pay for architects, artists, stained glass artisans, masons, carvers, craftsman and labourers and other expenses. Five years after construction ended, in 1511, the dome collapsed and work on the cathedral recommenced. The dome again collapsed in 1888, and work was still being performed on the dome until at least 1903. The 1888 collapse occurred due to an earthquake and resulted in the destruction of every precious object below the dome at that time. The interior has the longest nave of any cathedral in Spain. The central nave rises to a height of 42 meters and is lavishly decorated with a large quantity of gilding. In the main body of the cathedral, the most noticeable features are the great boxlike choir loft, which fills the central portion of the nave, and the vast Gothic retablo of carved scenes from the life of Christ. This altarpiece was the lifetime work of a single craftsman, Pierre Dancart. The builders used some columns and other elements from the ancient mosque, including its minaret, which was converted into a bell tower known as La Giralda, now the city's most well-known symbol. La Giralda The Giralda is the bell tower of the Cathedral of Seville. Its height is 343 feet (105 m) feet. Its square base is 23 feet (7.0 m) above sea level and is 44 feet (13 m) feet long per side. It was built to resemble the minaret of the Koutoubia Mosque in Marrakech (Morocco), although the top section of the bell tower dates from the Renaissance. Construction began in 1184 under the direction of architect Ben Ahmad Baso. According to the chronicler Ibn Sahib al-Salah, the works were completed on March 10 of 1198, with the placement of four gilt bronze balls in the top section of the tower. After a strong earthquake in 1365, the spheres were missing. In the 16th century the belfry was added by the architect Hernán Ruiz; the statue on its top, called El Giraldillo, was installed in 1568 to represent the triumph of the Christian faith. West facade The Door of Baptism, on the left side, was built in the 15th century and decorated with a scene depicting the baptism of Jesus, created by the workshop of Lorenzo Mercadante of Britain. It is of Gothic style with a pointed archivolt decorated with tracery. It contains sculptures of the brothers Saint Isidore and Saint Leander and the sisters Saints Justa and Rufina, by Lorenzo Mecadante, also a series of angels and prophets by the artisan Pedro Millán. The Main Door or Door of Assumption, in the center of the west facade, is well-preserved and elaborately decorated. Cardinal Cienfuegos y Jovellanos commissioned the artist Ricardo Bellver to carve the relief of the Assumption over the door; it was executed between 1877 and 1898. The Door of Saint Michael or Door of the Nativity, has sculptures representing the birth of Jesus by Pedro Millan. It was built in the 15th century and is decorated with terracotta sculptures of Saint Laurean, Saint Hermengild and the Four Evangelists. Today, this door is used for the Holy Week processions. South facade The Door of Saint Cristopher or De la Lonja (1887-1895) of the south transept, was designed by Adolfo Fernandez Casanova and completed in 1917; it was originally designed by the architect Demetrio de los Rios in 1866. A replica of the &amp;quot;Giraldillo&amp;quot; stands in front of its gate. North facade The Door of the Conception (1895-1927), (Puerta de la Concepción) opens onto the Court of the Oranges (Patio de los Naranjos) and is kept closed except on festival days. It was designed by Demetrio de los Rios and finished by Adolfo Fernandez Casanova in 1895. It was built in the Gothic style to harmonize with the rest of the building. The Door of the Sanctary (Puerta del Sagrario) provides access to the sanctary. Designed by Pedro Sanchez Falconete in the last third of the 17th century, it is framed by Corinthian columns with a sculpture on top representing King Ferdinand III of Castile next to the Saints Isidore, Leander, Justa and Rufina. Door of Forgiveness. This door gives access to the Patio de los Naranjos from Calle Alemanes and therefore is not really a door of the cathedral. It belonged to the ancient mosque and retains its horseshoe arch shape from that time. In the early 16th century it was adorned with terracotta sculptures by the sculptor Miguel Perrin, highlighting the great relief of the Purification on the entrance arch. The plaster ornaments were made by Bartolomé López. East facade The Door of Sticks or the Adoration of the Magi, decorated with sculptures by Lope Marin in 1548, has a relief of the Adoration of the Magi at the top, executed by Miguel Perrin in 1520. The name Palos; or Sticks is due to the wooden railing which separates that area from the rest of the building. Door of the Bells, so named because at the time of its construction the bells to call the workers were rung there. The Renaissance sculptures and the relief on the tympanum representing Christ's Entry into Jerusalem were made by Lope Marin in 1548." id="8296303228" latitude="0" license="2" longitude="0" nbComments="0" rank="86" tags="spain espana seville sevilla santiagodecompostella extremadura granada cordoba ronda" title="Seville Cathedral roof collapse, 1 August 1888, after an earthquake" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/8218/8296303228_00c37fe36a_b.jpg" username="james_gordon_losangeles" views="9" />

<photo  date_taken="2008-11-02 12:31:04" description="The Cathedral of Saint Mary of the See (Spanish: Catedral de Santa María de la Sede), better known as Sevilla Cathedral, is a Roman Catholic cathedral in Sevilla (Andalusia, Spain). It is the largest Gothic cathedral and the third-largest church in the world. It was registered in 1987 by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, along with the Alcázar palace complex and the General Archive of the Indies. After its completion in the early 16th century, Seville Cathedral supplanted Hagia Sophia as the largest cathedral in the world, a title the Byzantine church had held for nearly a thousand years. The cathedral is also the burial site of Christopher Columbus. The Archbishop's Palace is located on the northeastern side of the cathedral. Interior of the cathedral. Seville Cathedral was built to demonstrate the city's wealth, as it had become a major trading center in the years after the Reconquista in 1248. In July 1401 it was decided to build a new cathedral since the structure of the current building, an ancient Muslim mosque which had been converted into a Christian church, was so badly damaged by the 1356 earthquake. According to local oral tradition, the members of the cathedral chapter said: &amp;quot;Let us build a church so beautiful and so great that those who see it built will think we were mad&amp;quot;. Construction began in 1402 and continued until 1506. The clergy of the parish gave half their stipends to pay for architects, artists, stained glass artisans, masons, carvers, craftsman and labourers and other expenses. Five years after construction ended, in 1511, the dome collapsed and work on the cathedral recommenced. The dome again collapsed in 1888, and work was still being performed on the dome until at least 1903. The 1888 collapse occurred due to an earthquake and resulted in the destruction of &amp;quot;every precious object below&amp;quot; the dome at that time. The interior has the longest nave of any cathedral in Spain. The central nave rises to a height of 42 meters and is lavishly decorated with a large quantity of gilding. In the main body of the cathedral, the most noticeable features are the great boxlike choir loft, which fills the central portion of the nave, and the vast Gothic retablo of carved scenes from the life of Christ. This altarpiece was the lifetime work of a single craftsman, Pierre Dancart. The builders used some columns and other elements from the ancient mosque, including its minaret, which was converted into a bell tower known as La Giralda, now the city's most well-known symbol. La Giralda The Giralda is the bell tower of the Cathedral of Seville. Its height is 343 feet (105 m) feet. Its square base is 23 feet (7.0 m) above sea level and is 44 feet (13 m) feet long per side. It was built to resemble the minaret of the Koutoubia Mosque in Marrakech (Morocco), although the top section of the bell tower dates from the Renaissance. Construction began in 1184 under the direction of architect Ben Ahmad Baso. According to the chronicler Ibn Sahib al-Salah, the works were completed on March 10 of 1198, with the placement of four gilt bronze balls in the top section of the tower.

Seville Cathedral was built to demonstrate the city's wealth, as it had become a major trading center in the years after the Reconquista in 1248. In July 1401 it was decided to build a new cathedral since the structure of the current building, an ancient Muslim mosque which had been converted into a Christian church, was so badly damaged by the 1356 earthquake. According to local oral tradition, the members of the cathedral chapter said: &amp;quot;Let us build a church so beautiful and so great that those who see it built will think we were mad&amp;quot;. Construction began in 1402 and continued until 1506. The clergy of the parish gave half their stipends to pay for architects, artists, stained glass artisans, masons, carvers, craftsman and labourers and other expenses. Five years after construction ended, in 1511, the dome collapsed and work on the cathedral recommenced. The dome again collapsed in 1888, and work was still being performed on the dome until at least 1903. The 1888 collapse occurred due to an earthquake and resulted in the destruction of &amp;quot;every precious object below&amp;quot; the dome at that time. The interior has the longest nave of any cathedral in Spain. The central nave rises to a height of 42 meters and is lavishly decorated with a large quantity of gilding. In the main body of the cathedral, the most noticeable features are the great boxlike choir loft, which fills the central portion of the nave, and the vast Gothic retablo of carved scenes from the life of Christ. This altarpiece was the lifetime work of a single craftsman, Pierre Dancart. The builders used some columns and other elements from the ancient mosque, including its minaret, which was converted into a bell tower known as La Giralda, now the city's most well-known symbol. La Giralda The Giralda is the bell tower of the Cathedral of Seville. Its height is 343 feet (105 m) feet. Its square base is 23 feet (7.0 m) above sea level and is 44 feet (13 m) feet long per side. It was built to resemble the minaret of the Koutoubia Mosque in Marrakech (Morocco), although the top section of the bell tower dates from the Renaissance. Construction began in 1184 under the direction of architect Ben Ahmad Baso. According to the chronicler Ibn Sahib al-Salah, the works were completed on March 10 of 1198, with the placement of four gilt bronze balls in the top section of the tower. After a strong earthquake in 1365, the spheres were missing. In the 16th century the belfry was added by the architect Hernán Ruiz; the statue on its top, called &amp;quot;El Giraldillo&amp;quot;, was installed in 1568 to represent the triumph of the Christian faith. West facade The Door of Baptism, on the left side, was built in the 15th century and decorated with a scene depicting the baptism of Jesus, created by the workshop of Lorenzo Mercadante of Britain. It is of Gothic style with a pointed archivolt decorated with tracery. It contains sculptures of the brothers Saint Isidore and Saint Leander and the sisters Saints Justa and Rufina, by Lorenzo Mecadante, also a series of angels and prophets by the artisan Pedro Millán. The Main Door or Door of Assumption, in the center of the west facade, is well-preserved and elaborately decorated. Cardinal Cienfuegos y Jovellanos commissioned the artist Ricardo Bellver to carve the relief of the Assumption over the door; it was executed between 1877 and 1898. The Door of Saint Michael or Door of the Nativity, has sculptures representing the birth of Jesus by Pedro Millan. It was built in the 15th century and is decorated with terracotta sculptures of Saint Laurean, Saint Hermengild and the Four Evangelists. Today, this door is used for the Holy Week processions. South facade The Door of Saint Cristopher or De la Lonja (1887-1895) of the south transept, was designed by Adolfo Fernandez Casanova and completed in 1917; it was originally designed by the architect Demetrio de los Rios in 1866. A replica of the &amp;quot;Giraldillo&amp;quot; stands in front of its gate. North facade The Door of the Conception (1895-1927), (Puerta de la Concepción) opens onto the Court of the Oranges (Patio de los Naranjos) and is kept closed except on festival days. It was designed by Demetrio de los Rios and finished by Adolfo Fernandez Casanova in 1895. It was built in the Gothic style to harmonize with the rest of the building. The Door of the Sanctary (Puerta del Sagrario) provides access to the sanctary. Designed by Pedro Sanchez Falconete in the last third of the 17th century, it is framed by Corinthian columns with a sculpture on top representing King Ferdinand III of Castile next to the Saints Isidore, Leander, Justa and Rufina. Door of Forgiveness. This door gives access to the Patio de los Naranjos from Calle Alemanes and therefore is not really a door of the cathedral. It belonged to the ancient mosque and retains its horseshoe arch shape from that time. In the early 16th century it was adorned with terracotta sculptures by the sculptor Miguel Perrin, highlighting the great relief of the Purification on the entrance arch. The plaster ornaments were made by Bartolomé López. East facade The Door of Sticks or the Adoration of the Magi, decorated with sculptures by Lope Marin in 1548, has a relief of the Adoration of the Magi at the top, executed by Miguel Perrin in 1520. The name Palos or Sticks is due to the wooden railing which separates that area from the rest of the building. Door of the Bells, so named because at the time of its construction the bells to call the workers were rung there. The Renaissance sculptures and the relief on the tympanum representing Christ's Entry into Jerusalem were made by Lope Marin in 1548." id="8296344444" latitude="0" license="2" longitude="0" nbComments="0" rank="92" tags="spain espana seville sevilla santiagodecompostella extremadura granada cordoba ronda" title="Door of the Forgiveness, Catedral de Santa María de la Sede, Sevilla, España" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/8079/8296344444_18a199808b_b.jpg" username="james_gordon_losangeles" views="5" />

<photo  date_taken="2012-12-21 21:19:41" description="Pierre Dancart's masterpiece, considered one of the finest altarpieces in the world. The most spectacular part of the interior of the Catedral de Santa María de la Sede is undoubtedly the golden Retablo Mayor (main altarpiece) in the main chapel. This magnificent masterpiece was designed by the Flemish craftsman Pierre Dancart who worked for 44 years on the reliefs, starting in 1482. The altarpiece was finished in 1564 with help from other artists. Large iron grilles, forged between 1518 and 1532, separate visitors from the altarpiece. The Retablo Mayor, the largest altarpiece in the world, consists of 36 gilded relief panels depicting scenes from the old testament and the lives of saints. At the altar in front of the wall of gold sits a statue of Santa Maria de la Sede, the patron saint of the Cathedral. The Cathedral of Saint Mary of the See (Spanish: Catedral de Santa María de la Sede), better known as Sevilla Cathedral, is a Roman Catholic cathedral in Sevilla (Andalusia, Spain). It is the largest Gothic cathedral and the third-largest church in the world. It was registered in 1987 by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, along with the Alcázar palace complex and the General Archive of the Indies. After its completion in the early 16th century, Seville Cathedral supplanted Hagia Sophia as the largest cathedral in the world, a title the Byzantine church had held for nearly a thousand years. The cathedral is also the burial site of Christopher Columbus. The Archbishop's Palace is located on the northeastern side of the cathedral. Interior of the cathedral. Seville Cathedral was built to demonstrate the city's wealth, as it had become a major trading center in the years after the Reconquista in 1248. In July 1401 it was decided to build a new cathedral since the structure of the current building, an ancient Muslim mosque which had been converted into a Christian church, was so badly damaged by the 1356 earthquake. According to local oral tradition, the members of the cathedral chapter said: &amp;quot;Let us build a church so beautiful and so great that those who see it built will think we were mad&amp;quot;. Construction began in 1402 and continued until 1506. The clergy of the parish gave half their stipends to pay for architects, artists, stained glass artisans, masons, carvers, craftsman and labourers and other expenses. Five years after construction ended, in 1511, the dome collapsed and work on the cathedral recommenced. The dome again collapsed in 1888, and work was still being performed on the dome until at least 1903. The 1888 collapse occurred due to an earthquake and resulted in the destruction of &amp;quot;every precious object below&amp;quot; the dome at that time. The interior has the longest nave of any cathedral in Spain. The central nave rises to a height of 42 meters and is lavishly decorated with a large quantity of gilding. In the main body of the cathedral, the most noticeable features are the great boxlike choir loft, which fills the central portion of the nave, and the vast Gothic retablo of carved scenes from the life of Christ. This altarpiece was the lifetime work of a single craftsman, Pierre Dancart. The builders used some columns and other elements from the ancient mosque, including its minaret, which was converted into a bell tower known as La Giralda, now the city's most well-known symbol. La Giralda The Giralda is the bell tower of the Cathedral of Seville. Its height is 343 feet (105 m) feet. Its square base is 23 feet (7.0 m) above sea level and is 44 feet (13 m) feet long per side. It was built to resemble the minaret of the Koutoubia Mosque in Marrakech (Morocco), although the top section of the bell tower dates from the Renaissance. Construction began in 1184 under the direction of architect Ben Ahmad Baso. According to the chronicler Ibn Sahib al-Salah, the works were completed on March 10 of 1198, with the placement of four gilt bronze balls in the top section of the tower. After a strong earthquake in 1365, the spheres were missing. In the 16th century the belfry was added by the architect Hernán Ruiz; the statue on its top, called &amp;quot;El Giraldillo&amp;quot;, was installed in 1568 to represent the triumph of the Christian faith. West facade The Door of Baptism, on the left side, was built in the 15th century and decorated with a scene depicting the baptism of Jesus, created by the workshop of Lorenzo Mercadante of Britain. It is of Gothic style with a pointed archivolt decorated with tracery. It contains sculptures of the brothers Saint Isidore and Saint Leander and the sisters Saints Justa and Rufina, by Lorenzo Mecadante, also a series of angels and prophets by the artisan Pedro Millán. The Main Door or Door of Assumption, in the center of the west facade, is well-preserved and elaborately decorated. Cardinal Cienfuegos y Jovellanos commissioned the artist Ricardo Bellver to carve the relief of the Assumption over the door; it was executed between 1877 and 1898. The Door of Saint Michael or Door of the Nativity, has sculptures representing the birth of Jesus by Pedro Millan. It was built in the 15th century and is decorated with terracotta sculptures of Saint Laurean, Saint Hermengild and the Four Evangelists. Today, this door is used for the Holy Week processions. South facade The Door of Saint Cristopher or De la Lonja (1887-1895) of the south transept, was designed by Adolfo Fernandez Casanova and completed in 1917; it was originally designed by the architect Demetrio de los Rios in 1866.
