The temple is renowned for its &amp;quot;Great Buddha&amp;quot; (Daibutsu), a monumental outdoor bronze statue of Amida Buddha which is one of the most famous icons of Japan. The Great Buddha of Kamakura is a monumental outdoor bronze statue of Amitābha Buddha located at the Kōtoku-in Temple in Kamakura, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. The bronze statue probably dates from 1252, in the Kamakura period, according to temple records. It was preceded by a giant wooden Buddha, which was completed in 1243 after ten years of continuous labor. That wooden statue was damaged by a storm in 1248, and the hall containing it was destroyed. Its successor was a bronze image. At one time, the statue was gilded. There are still traces of gold leaf near the statue's ears. It is unclear, however, whether the statue constructed in 1252 is the same statue as the present statue." id="6172348875" latitude="35.316831" license="4" longitude="139.535689" nbComments="0" rank="2" tags="kamakura daibutsu greatbuddha japan kōtoku kotoku temple buddhisttemple" title="Kamakura, Daibutsu (Great Buddha)" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/6173/6172348875_2f9dd506a2_b.jpg" username="Arian Zwegers" views="153" />

From the entry ticket: &amp;quot;&lt;i&gt;This bronze statue of Amita Buddha was cast in 1252 A.D. by the sculptors Ono-Goroemon and Tanji-Hisatomo at the request of Miss Inadano-Tsubone and Priest Joko, who not only originated the idea of building this large statue and the temple covering it, but also collected donations for it. In 1498, a tidal wave swept away the great temple of the Buddha, leaving only the foundation stones. In the 500 years since then, the holy statue has been exposed to sunshine, storms, and snow. The latest repair was done in 1960-1961, to strengthen the Buddha's neck and to make it possible for the Buddha's body to move freely on the base to prevent a damaging shock to the statue in case of an earthquake. The statue is 13.35 meters tall, and weighs 121 tons.&lt;/i&gt;&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://loc.alize.us/#/flickr:247944487&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;See where this picture was taken.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/groups/geotagging/discuss/72157594165549916/&quot;&gt;[?]&lt;/a&gt;" id="247944487" latitude="35.316841" license="3" longitude="139.535573" nbComments="8" rank="24" tags="daibutsu kamakura buddha japan 日本 nihon nippon onlyyourbestshots asia earthasia siddhartha gautama 大仏 geotagged buddhist geo:lat=35316841 geo:lon=139535573 honshū travel bronze kōtokuin 高徳院" title="Lonely outdoor Buddha; Kamakura, Japan" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/94/247944487_cf15c348bb_b.jpg" username="xopherlance" views="374" />

<photo  date_taken="1915-01-01 00:00:00" description="Image Description from historic lecture booklet: &amp;quot;Inseparable from the remembrance of temples seen in Japan is the great bronze statue of Buddha, which for nearly five centuries has sat serene and lonely amid the trees of the temple gardens of Kamakura, This colossal embodiment in bronze of the founder of Buddhism, nearly fifty feet in height, is the one relic of the magnificent temple which, once stood at Kamakura, then a town of more than a million souls. The city and the temple were swept away by the tidal wave of the great Pacific, but the great statue of Buddha remained unmoved amid the wreck of houses and the wild scene of awful death and destruction. Its eyes of gold have looked unemotionally upon death and life for many centuries, and upon millions of pilgrims who, during the last five hundred years, have bowed in worship before it. There is no Sunday in Japan, no special days set apart for offerings and worship of this idol. Prayers almost continually ascend before it, offerings are made every day in the year; but on certain days of each month special forms of worship are used. To most travelers this figure seems to stand for the material embodiment of Buddhism, the calm, serene impassivity taught by the Buddhist faith. To the Japanese it may mean much or little, according to individual temperament; it does not though, really represent the religion of Japan, which lies deeper than the worship of this isolated colossal figure of Buddha.&amp;quot; Original Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides Item Number: P217:set 060 011 You can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking &lt;a href=&quot;http://oregondigital.org/digcol&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

<photo  date_taken="1914-09-01 00:00:00" description="Well, times change and so do our notions of what's acceptable language. At the turn of the 20th century, the photographer opted to refer to this famous statue of the Buddha as an &amp;quot;idol,&amp;quot; a usage that would be frowned upon today. Still, since this is a historical document, I felt it would be wrong of me to crop or photoshop the caption Uncle Elstner gave this photo in the teens of the last century. However, this does not mean I endorse the term or any of its many negative connotations. According to Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Daibutsu (大仏 or in traditional orthography (kyūjitai) 大佛) is a Japanese word meaning literally 'Large Buddha' that refers to large statues of the Buddha or one of his various incarnations.&amp;quot; The statue at Kamakura is one of the score or so statues of Buddha that are large enough to warrant being called a &amp;quot;daibutsu.&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daibutsu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daibutsu&lt;/a&gt; Wikipedia tells us the following about the statue of the Buddha at Kamakura: &amp;quot;The Great Buddha of Kamakura is a monumental outdoor bronze statue of Amitābha Buddha located at the Kōtoku-in Temple in Kamakura, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The bronze statue probably dates from 1252, in the Kamakura period, according to temple records. It was preceded by a giant wooden Buddha, which was completed in 1243 'after five years of continuous labor', the funds having been raised by Lady Inadano-Tsubone and the Buddhist priest Joukou of Toutoumi.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;That wooden statue was damaged by a storm in 1248, and the hall containing it was destroyed, so Joukou suggested making another statue of bronze, and the huge amount of money necessary for this and for a new hall was raised for the project. The sculptors were Ono Goroemaon and Tanji Hisatomo. At one time, the statue was gilded. There are still traces of gold leaf near the statue's ears. The hall was destroyed by a storm in 1334, was rebuilt, and was damaged by yet another storm in 1369, and was rebuilt yet again.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;It is unclear, however, whether the statue constructed in 1252 is the same statue as the present statue. The building housing the statue was washed away in the tsunami of September 20th, 1498 during the Muromachi period.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The statue is approximately 13.35 meters tall and weighs approximately 93 tons. The statue is hollow, and visitors can view the interior. Many visitors over the years have left graffiti on the inside of the statue.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;At one time, there were thirty-two bronze lotus petals at the base of the statue, but only four remain, and they are no longer in place.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;A notice at the entrance to the grounds reads, 'Stranger, whosoever thou art and whatsoever be thy creed, when thou enterest this sanctuary remember thou treadest upon ground hallowed by the worship of ages. This is the Temple of Bhudda (sic) and the gate of the eternal, and should therefore be entered with reverence.' &amp;quot; &amp;quot;Since the last hall was washed away in 1498, the Great Buddha has stood in the open air. The Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 destroyed the base the statue sits upon, but the base was repaired in 1925. Repairs to the statue were carried out in 1960-1961, when the neck was strengthened and measures were taken to protect it from earthquakes.&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kōtoku-in&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kōtoku-in&lt;/a&gt; The statue is located in the Kotokuin Temple. This photo is from an album my spouse's uncle Elstner Hilton compiled in Japan between 1914 and 1918. While Uncle Elstner was pretty good about annotating the photos that required an explanation of some sort, he did not date the pictures. So all we know is they date to between January, 1914 and December, 1918." id="4860486747" latitude="0" license="4" longitude="0" nbComments="0" rank="31" tags="japan vintagephotofromjapan oldjapan prewarjapan expat thegreatbuddhaofkamakura daibutsuatkamakura 日本 神奈川県 鎌倉市 高徳院 鎌倉大仏 大仏 仏像 阿弥陀如来 大正時代 taishoera" title="Idols - Daibutsu at Kamakura" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/4142/4860486747_f249c07a26_b.jpg" username="A.Davey" views="393" />

It's total weight is in excess of 125 metric tons despite the fact that it is mostly hollow. While it is only 7/10 the size of the Daibutsu in Nara, it is regarded by many as a greater work of art. Kotoku-in is a Jodo temple in Kamakura founded in 1243. The original temple complex was destroyed in several storms, leaving it's giant Daibutsu exposed. The Buddha statue has become one of the most popular tourist attractions in the Kanto area and symbol of Kamakura. The great Buddha of Todai-ji in Nara was the original inspiration for the statue.

Constructed in 752 as the head temple of all provincial Buddhist temples of Japan under the order of Emperor Shōmu, it quickly grew so powerful that the capital was moved out of Nara to lower its influence on government affairs. Its Great Buddha Hall (大仏殿, Daibutsuden), the largest wooden building in the world, houses the world's largest bronze statue of the Great Buddha Vairocana, known in Japanese simply as Daibutsu (大仏). According to records kept by Tōdai-ji, more than 2.6 million people in total helped construct the Great Buddha and its hall. Under the Ritsuryō system of government in the Nara Period, Buddhism was heavily regulated by the state through the Sōgō (僧綱, Office of Priestly Affairs), and Tōdai-ji served as the central administrative temple for the provincial temples for the six Buddhist schools in Japan at the time: the Hossō, Kegon, Jōjitsu, Sanron, Ritsu and Kusha. But as the center of power in Japanese Buddhism shifted away from Nara to Mount Hiei and the Tendai sect, and later when the capital of Japan moved to Kamakura, Tōdai-ji's authoritative role declined as well. On the Daibutsu's right is the Kokūzō Bosatsu (虚空蔵菩薩), the Bodhisattva of Wisdom &amp;amp; Memory. The Kokūzō Bosatsu (Sanskrit: Ākāśagarbha Bodhisattva, Tibetan: Namkhai Nyingpo Chinese: 虛空藏菩薩, Xū kōng zàng pú sà, Korean: 허공장보살) is one of the eight great bodhisattvas. His name can be translated as &amp;quot;boundless space treasury&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;void store&amp;quot; as his wisdom is said to be boundless as space itself. Tōdai-ji, along with several Buddhist temples including Kōfuku-ji, Kasuga Taisha, the remains of Heijō Palace, and other sites in Nara, comprise the UNESCO World Heritage Site, Historic Monuments of Ancient Nara, inscribed in 1999." id="5889695616" latitude="34.688902" license="3" longitude="135.839888" nbComments="0" rank="47" tags="lotuspetal lotuspetals pedestal replica daibutsu 大仏 kyūjitai vairocana vairochana mahāvairocana mahavairocana vairocanabuddha 大日如来 dainichinyorai 毘盧遮那仏 birushanabutsu daibutsuden greatbuddhahall 大仏殿 tōdaiji todaiji greateasterntemple 東大寺 temple buddhisttemple buddhist nara 奈良 naracity 奈良市 narashi naraprefecture 奈良県 naraken kansairegion 関西地方 kansaichihō kansai kansaichiho kinkiregion 近畿地方 kinkichihō kinkichiho honshu 本州 honshū japan nihon nippon 日本国 日本 unescoworldheritagesite worldheritagesite historicmonumentsofancientnara" title="Nara: Tōdai-ji- Replica of the Lotus Petals of the Great Buddha's Pedestal" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/5078/5889695616_5b0a474d14_b.jpg" username="wallyg" views="53" />

<photo  date_taken="2012-04-05 14:08:55" description="The Great Buddha of Kamakura probably dates from 1252, in the Kamakura period, according to temple records. It was preceded by a giant wooden Buddha, which was completed in 1243 after ten years of continuous labor, the funds having been raised by Lady Inadano-Tsubone and the Buddhist priest Jōkō of Tōtōmi. That wooden statue was damaged by a storm in 1248, and the hall containing it was destroyed, so Jōkō suggested making another statue of bronze, and the huge amount of money necessary for this and for a new hall was raised for the project. The bronze image was probably cast by Ōno Gorōemon or Tanji Hisatomo, both leading casters of the time. At one time, the statue was gilded. There are still traces of gold leaf near the statue's ears. It is unclear, however, whether the statue constructed in 1252 is the same statue as the present statue. The hall was destroyed by a storm in 1334, was rebuilt, and was damaged by yet another storm in 1369, and was rebuilt yet again. The last building housing the statue was washed away in the tsunami of September 20th, 1498 during the Muromachi period. Since then, the Great Buddha has stood in the open air.

Roughly 15 meters in height (the face itself nearly 2.5 meters long), this statue weighs 93 tons. Upon the head are 656 hair curls, a traditional characteristic of the Amida Buddha. The silver boss on the forehead (from which emanates the light that illuminates the universe) weighs 30 pounds. Amida, which means Infinite Light or Infinite Life, is one of the loftiest savior figures in Japanese Buddhism, and Amida faith is concerned primarily with the life to come (paradise). Amida is especially important to Japan's Pure Land sects. The key practice for Amida devotees is simply to chant Amida's name, &amp;quot;Namu Amida Butsu,&amp;quot; for Amida vowed that whoever calls his name with faith shall be reborn in the Western Pure Land. Rebirth in the Pure Land represents a &amp;quot;quick path&amp;quot; to enlightenment." id="137029010" latitude="35.310502" license="4" longitude="139.550743" nbComments="0" rank="147" tags="kamakura japan" title="kamakura10" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/49/137029010_144ca8ea30_b.jpg" username="Flowizm" views="433" />
