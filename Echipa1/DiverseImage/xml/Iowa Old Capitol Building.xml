Not sure about a specific law on the books in Iowa? Look no further than the second floor of the Iowa State Capitol. This is the Iowa State Law library. It's main feature (besides hundreds of thousands of books) is a pair of spiral staircases on the North and South ends of the library. The rest of the library is finished in beautiful mosaic tiles, rich woods and amazing lighting fixtures. This place is immaculate - and beautiful. Someday, I want to try and get to the top of one of those bookshelves and shoot here again. &lt;u&gt;More information:&lt;/u&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.statelibraryofiowa.org/services/collections/law-library&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.statelibraryofiowa.org/services/collections/law-library&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.legis.iowa.gov/Resources/tourCapitol.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.legis.iowa.gov/Resources/tourCapitol.aspx&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iptv.org/simplepleasures/story.cfm?id=2852&amp;amp;type=story&amp;amp;video=video&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.iptv.org/simplepleasures/story.cfm?id=2852&amp;amp;type=s...&lt;/a&gt;" id="6608344765" latitude="41.590989" license="3" longitude="-93.604202" nbComments="16" rank="11" tags="2011 canon 7d 1585 indoor law legal library desmoines iowa capitol building statecapitol reading studying stairs spiralstairs mountainsofbooks tall vertirama photostitching hdr nik hdrefx vanguard w4nd3rlost jason mrachina historical history important tables aweinspiring old heights desmoinesisnotboring altapro 263at soetop50top50spotstoshootindesmoines" title="Iowa State Capitol - Law Library" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/7155/6608344765_747ba5cdd2_b.jpg" username="w4nd3rl0st (InspiredinDesMoines)" views="1791" />
<photo  date_taken="2012-09-07 10:34:29" description="The Iowa Capitol Building contains both the State House of Representatives and State Senate. This is the House of Representatives. It's been restored to its original glory as part of a larger restoration project. One interesting fact, there is no wall paper in the entire capitol building. Everything is stenciled on by a group of talented (full-time) restoration painters. The Iowa House of Representatives is the lower house of the Iowa General Assembly. There are 100 members of the House of Representatives, representing 100 single-member districts across the state with populations of approximately 29,750 for each constituency. The entire chamber serves two-year terms and then goes up for re-election as an entire group every even-numbered year. There are no term limits. Each congressmen will earn $25,000 in salary plus per diems. &lt;u&gt;More Info:&lt;/u&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.legis.iowa.gov/index.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.legis.iowa.gov/index.aspx&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_State_Capitol&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_State_Capitol&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_House_of_Representatives&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_House_of_Representatives&lt;/a&gt;" id="7974650163" latitude="41.591414" license="3" longitude="-93.603826" nbComments="18" rank="12" tags="2012 indoor iowa desmoines capitol complex lowerhouse iowageneralassembly generalassembly congressman congresswoman republican democrat vote legislature law legal housefloor old restored vintage chandelier glass gaslight carpet floor floorofcongress historic fall windows large stockart screensaver stockphotography artwork frameableart stock" title="Iowa State House" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/8308/7974650163_c25ac3cd4c_b.jpg" username="w4nd3rl0st (InspiredinDesMoines)" views="403" />

The flag and star were hung in the late 1800's by the &amp;quot;Grand Army of the Republic&amp;quot;. It's remained there ever since. &lt;u&gt;The Capitol&lt;/u&gt; The five domed Iowa State Capitol Building was built between 1871 and 1886. It houses the Senate, Legislature, Governor's Office, and some other important groups. The best feature is the central towering dome constructed of iron and brick and covered with 23 carat gold. The gold leafing was replaced in 1964-1965 at a cost of $79,938. The dome is 275 feet above the ground floor and is 67 feet in diameter. Four smaller domes of simple design rise from the four corners of the Capitol. The Capitol grounds overlooks the city from a very large hill and is part of the East Village area. It's a great place to see fireworks in the summer or attend a political rally (of which there are many).

Not sure about a specific law on the books in Iowa? Look no further than the second floor of the Iowa State Capitol. This is the Iowa State Law library. It's main feature (besides hundreds of thousands of books) is a pair of spiral staircases on the North and South ends of the library. The rest of the library is finished in beautiful mosaic tiles, rich woods and amazing lighting fixtures. This place is immaculate - and beautiful. Someday, I want to try and get to the top of one of those bookshelves and shoot here again. &lt;u&gt;More information:&lt;/u&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.statelibraryofiowa.org/services/collections/law-library&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.statelibraryofiowa.org/services/collections/law-library&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.legis.iowa.gov/Resources/tourCapitol.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.legis.iowa.gov/Resources/tourCapitol.aspx&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iptv.org/simplepleasures/story.cfm?id=2852&amp;amp;type=story&amp;amp;video=video&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.iptv.org/simplepleasures/story.cfm?id=2852&amp;amp;type=s...&lt;/a&gt; There is another great view of this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/w4nd3rl0st/6608344765/lightbox/&quot;&gt;herek&lt;/a&gt;" id="7127175897" latitude="41.591053" license="3" longitude="-93.603644" nbComments="2" rank="16" tags="2012 canon 7d 1585 iowa desmoines dmcc cameraclub indoor capitol statecapitol dome tower copula photographer photography photostitching government buildings architecture fun photowalk midwest state legislature hallway grandhall arch pillar marble green gilded tile symmetry landscape old historic building famous tour dontmiss desmoinesisnotboring senate house representative representing constituency wallpaper desktop computer interesting art constituents" title="Capitol Law Library" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/7256/7127175897_eb6c937103_b.jpg" username="w4nd3rl0st (InspiredinDesMoines)" views="403" />

There are also monuments to WW2 submariners, Lincoln and Tad as well as many more. It's definitely worth a half day.

This was on the Senate side shooting all the way down to the basement (from halfway up the dome). This was made with the Vanguard Alta Pro 263AT. It has an extended arm that I was able to hang out over the middle of the staircase. The tripod did great - the longest exposure was over 10 seconds.

Each night for the past few days, CBS, CSPAN and FOX News have all broadcast from various locations inside the Iowa Capitol Complex. CBS got the Law Library, Fox got the Grand Hallway (under the dome) and CSPAN got the House Chambers. This is the CBS temporary stage. I must say as a photographer, I am jealous of the lighting set up. It is beyond perfect - every object near the stage seemed to glow. You can see the teleprompters, the camera, the lighting and sound boards, as well as the overhead lights. This was the SOUTH side of the library. The NORTH side was business as usual - see my the next photo my stream. I can't wait to go back here when the library is back to normal. It was neat to see the &amp;quot;other side of the TV&amp;quot;, but it was difficult to shoot around.

<photo  date_taken="2012-05-03 09:48:18" description="Long! But worth the read... The international exchange students interviewed by Stephen and Claudia, Southeast Polk Senior High School Student Council members--the moderators were: Air Singkaravanich -Thailand Almaz Kamalov - Russia Andreas Ebert - Germany Daisy Sun - China Giammarco Miani - Italy Martina Hudak - Serbia (at Baxter High School, today's guest) Munif Khan - Blangladesh Raissa Pinheiro Alves - Netherlands/Brazil Reneta Krivonozova - Bulgaria (at Baxter High School, today's guest) Simon Bellwald - Switzerland Suzy Grigoryan - Armenia (By student guest blogger: Jessica Dost (Freshman) and a few edit by the exchange student) Okay, this is the session for students from SEP to ask the foreign exchange students questions. It'll be really intriguing, and I'll try to get all the questions answered and typed out. Hope you enjoy! Next will be the &amp;quot;Taste of the Nations&amp;quot;. I'm a bit nervous right now for the food. Please note that this session will be connected with Twitter and Facebook as to let students share the information we learn about the session. if you would like to read some of these tweets look up at #SEPCulture. Q: How do you feel differently about coming to America? A: Munif: My accent has changed so far. This is the longest time I have been away from home. I will be a different man once I return back home. Andreas: It feels like 10 years full of change. Over the time I have spent here, I have learned about myself and how my host family is different from my family at home. I appreciate my family at home more and I really miss my family at home. Simon: improved relationship with sister back home, learned a lot about myself. Giammarco: I am more lazy, appreciate others more. Several exchange students: gained weight. Some others: We had the opportunity to see Chicago, Arizona, Las Vegas, Texas. Q:What have you seen outside of Iowa in the United States? A:(Almaz) Texas stinks, loved Hoover Dam, Mall of America, Washington -- (Suzy) Capitol and the monuments in Washington D.C were really pretty Q: How easy to adapt A: (Simon ) Fairly easy. Lori Slings helped (Munif)! I am from farther east, really great change. We do not shake hands with our left hand. We do not say thank you as much as Americans do! (Suzy) At the new year (upset about it) Asian and Europe celebrate the holiday differently. (Andreas) At first would fit in, later on it was harder and harder; keep old values and add new; go back and re-adapt, every one diff (Air) Her tutor / foreign teacher , before coming to America, helped her understand that in America, smoking is not sexy, drugs, and that alcohol can is bad for teenagers. Q: Stayed in contact with friends? If so, how? (Andreas) Facebook yes, after a while contact dried out; not really part of each other's lives. This is hard and sad but still friends. (AIR) stayed in contact via Twitter and Facebook, school. We used to hang-out a lot, go eat, take pics back home. (Giammarco) Back home used to go to a lot of parties. In the U.S., I was doing nothing at first. It's different but better life, lost contact with those back home. I would get Facebook messages from home...Are you dead or alive? HA! It is hard to keep in contact when you have been gone a long time! Q: Embarrassing moments in America? ( Who would think? [both guest exchange student from Baxter High School and Haissa] When the teacher hands out paper, instead of taking one but handing out pieces of papers to the first one and expecting that person to hand them out, the exchange student just kept them all! Very embarrassing! (Haissa) (Daisy) only pointed at foods wanted in the cafeteria because they didn't know what to call the food items! Didn't like food (Munif)! Numerous embarrassing moments and STILL counting! (Almaz) rode the bus first day; got off first stop, walked off with younger kids, who didn't communicate when he asked where they were going! He didn't understand and they didn't understand. He ended up at the junior high on the top of the hill instead of the high school at the bottom of the campus!!! --We really need an Ambassador to stay with us for a day or two of the new school year! Q: Differences between schools (Simon) lot less homework in American schools; (Munif) requirement to keep above a C or no scholarship, less homework here, pages after pages, more practical study here in Iowa than theoretical work. Back home, I had to write more papers. Bangladesh-His British Curriculum high school--one class but teachers rotated from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. No freedom of passing time or choosing one's own classes. In America--different subjects, stricter and better. More awesome and friendlier teachers! (Andreas) strict and organized here, more freedoms in Germany, (embarrassing) Andreas didn't show up to study hall first couple of time. He had tardies, lots of them, as he didn't understand our system! (Many other exchange students shared) Our schools offer no extra-curricular activities. (Suzy) more stricter than in America: no makeup-jewelry, definitely no shorts. No long hair (Daisy) here is easier, not as many projects or presentations, so much fun here! Q:Are you through with school when return/what to come? Haissa : already graduated -- Simon of Switzerland - 3 years left I am 17 almost 18; high school is 5 years, 2 done but this year doesn't count, so I have three to go! (AIR) going to college (Bulgarian girl from Baxter High School) whole bunch of exams to graduate; hope to go to college for business (Andreas) I am a junior in high school. This was like a vacation here. (Daisy) Want to go to college in America to study science, (Munif) British Curriculum: One year to get prepared to take SAT/TOEFL test, and then I hope to go to a college in the USA in Kentucky, For many, this year as an exchange students was a &amp;quot;pause&amp;quot; year in their education. The experiences, however, were tremendous. Q: new words that you learned here that stand out -- make sure they are appropriate to share! (Andreas) &amp;quot;like&amp;quot; &amp;quot;just&amp;quot; &amp;quot;kinda&amp;quot;, I found the American language confusing first couple of weeks. In the beginning, I kept a list on my cell phone and then Igave up on that! Andreas learned a lot of farm words here in Iowa! He spent quality time at the Iowa State Fair and loved every minute of it! Q:What are the stereotypes that other countries have of the Americans? What improvements we can make? (Raissa) some think Americans are egotistical, not very smart, but we know that is not true! How could we improve the testing in our schools? The biggest issue is the multiple choice test. Really, what good is that? Let the students explain what they are learning! Make seniors have to take finals in all subjects. Tests could be harder--make the students really think and apply what they have learned. (Baxter High School exchange student) not everybody is blond, not everybody has iPods, in America not every city is big, not every one is obese. (Suzy) same as Haissa says! Our country see America through TV shows and thinks there are actresses and singers and etc. everywhere! Others think all Americans eat is fast food. This is not really true, not everyone is obese, as a matter of fact, my host family doesn't eat fast food. &amp;quot;Most of us have gained weight&amp;quot;--lots of exchange students nod their heads! But some where quick to say they had not! (Andreas) American TV shows just do not show the real picture of America! He says, not everyone lives the big social life, gets drunk--like TV depicts. The exchange students say, Americans are worried about stereotypes--that we think about how we looks /act and that we focus so much on what's behind the typical American. [Great thoughts to ponder!] Q: Is the military mandatory, women and men? (Simon) men are required after high school,24 or 48 weeks, 2 weeks each. He would like to join the Air Force or National Guard. He pointed out that Switzerland is neutral. They do not fight. After serving in the military, the people gets to keep their guns. Shooting in the back yard is not allowed. Out in the country, here, we can shoot guns in the backyard. (Suzy) mandatory, men after high school for 2 years, or college then army Q: Holidays, parades, etc.? (Baxter High School) Christmas, Easter, New Years--they just don't seem big here. This was disappointing. 6th of May and 1st of May, following the calendar, named after saint, so celebrate the saint! (Giammarco) more food in home country, fun to dance with grandmas and moms, different foods, New Years Eve is big, fireworks, throw plates out windows--dangerous sometimes, random holidays, medieval, we have orange fights where we throw oranges at people--back home! Sometimes it hurts. We celebrate! (Suzy) We are so proud that we are the first nation to adapt Christianity. Q:What about your religions? Do they differ from here? (Munif) Our country has mainly Muslims, and then Hindu, as well as a small number of Buddhist, Christians, and other religions. We have a festival known as Eid where we go to the field and pray--Last year in Russia, hundreds of thousands of people in streets, hugging, happy eve. amazing scene, lots of bowing. We must try to learn more about other religions and their practices. We need to respect religious practices of others. (Baxter exchange student) Quote: The world is a giant place, but it is also small.&amp;quot; We must begin to understand, accept, and connect with the diversity of others worldwide! Q: Can you describe a typical American thing you will remember when you go back: (Andreas) Iowa State Fair, host family in there, really different, fun, crowds of obese people, food, everything on stick, chocolate, amazing, food would always be like that, volunteering in different countries, free stuff, talking to people, really good time in first 2 weeks (Munif) Casey Owens, Mrs. VanHook, Mrs. Henning, Mr. Bredlow, Mr.Dietenbach, and all the other teachers and students. Winter formal, and dance, having senior pictures taken! (Baxter HS student) volunteering, prom and after prom, totally different, remember it forever (Giammarco) senior pictures, lots of different things, no prom back home, school sports, no sports back home. In America, the teen life is around the school! (Baxter HS student) Black Friday!!! Q: Describe social life back home: jobs, driving age, hobbies? (Haissa) Home: go to city, restaurants, get into clubs when 16, festivals, social life is big, rarely stayed home, parents not happy that we are never home, always outside and such. (Daisy) driving is 18, job is 18, child labor some places. No job for students under 18! (Munif) driving is 18, there are socioeconomic divisions, different levels--rich, middle class, and poor, with no dating between different divisions, not meant to date. Marriages are usually arranged by families, although with permission of bride and groom. Q: Are the boys and girls more beautiful here or in your country? (Baxter student) more beautiful here, boyfriends are jerks, cuter often equals meaner--cute boys are not necessarily nicer! (Almaz) this is one of the most common questions--answers differ whether the boy or girl is asking me the question. (Raissa) Brazilian boys, yes. Russians are the best, American boys are better. (Daisy) different opinions, Justin Beiber is cute although he IS Canadian! (Munif) Almaz is being polite--who are the best of the best, smart girls are not necessarily best looking! (Simon) American girls are very nice! The guys? Well, I don't really care about them! Q: What can you do in America that you can't do in your country? (Daisy) Facebook is illegal in China. (Simon) shooting guns in the back yard (Suzie) drinking age is 16 in Armenia. (Air) free stuff, download, and apple bees--not available in Thailand. (Andreas) You have to be a lot more mature for driving in Germany. 16 is not enough. (Giammarco) I miss the drinking age, not with friends, but with relatives. Weddings are awesome, at the end is traditional music, dancing. Q:What is most important thing in America (Andreas) Differences do not matter. W must all work together. (Suzy) learned about self, how much she loves her country, thinking she will go away and will never miss and wouldn't care but now she feels bad to be leaving America (Munif) When making fun of terrorism, if cross a certain point you will be bullying. (This was just for fun, no problems.) You shouldn't care when people are talking crude about you, My dad is in journalism and when I was a kid, I got the opportunity to work in the newspaper. (Simon) same as Suzie, awesome host family, but mom and dad are best, holidays in the beginning without family, learn how to handle (Reneta) world is giant and small at the same time) It's not only about you. It's cool to know about other countries. &amp;quot;The world is big but not that big&amp;quot; when you think about globalization. (Air) she loves her countries and parents (Martina) family and country, not as scared when public speaking, not scared to trying new things, (Daisy) Learned about self and country. Taiwan is country. She didn't know it before. When home she uses her money however she wants --sniffles a little bit. (Raissa) be more independent and appreciate parents and not take things for granted, (Italy) during the year you learn to be responsible. I was alone for the first and only time, when I leave my parents. At first, bye is alright. But then in the hotel room, I am all alone. And next the crazy adventure begins! After a week, I talk with host and family and I am fine without my family. But now, I appreciate more and I appreciate both of our cultures. (Almaz) everything is different not bad or worse, most exchange students don't like the food. But learning the difference is the fun part. Q: Tell us about one thing that reminds you of home. (Giammarco) pasta (Andreas) There are jokes about Nazis and Jews, German's past, and racism. The discrimination of one group of people against another group in the US schools can lead to racism. This should never happen. (Baxter HS student) dances (Simon) mountains in Arizona Q: Do you think your country is more diverse or vice-versa? Raissa: About the same, except for the different people. It's not just in Iowa either, it's the entire USA. [Not every region of the USA is the same!] Q: Are you sad to be returning back home? (Munif) sad and happy at the same time about leaving, fallen in love with school and teachers. (Simon) two sides, one here, and another home, people (Daisy) host mother, and will cry (Giammarco) Kinda sad but alright. It's a part of life. You just do not spend entire life with others you meet. You enjoy, learn from, build on you own character, and then move on. (Almaz) He'll miss being here! Q: Name one thing that you did here in America that you would not try at home. Giammarco: Shaving my head. I was on the swimming team. During the week of state conference I got sick that week, and didn't attend but I did shave my head anyway. A note from our student blogger, Jessica: Well that was pretty entertaining switching all the short notes I took during the Q&amp;amp;A session into full responses from each of the foreign exchange students. Just learning about their country and such was amazing. Everybody listening so intently to the person talking. From the questions that the students here at Southeast Polk had for the exchange. I'll be terribly upset when they leave, yet I'll be glad that they will be with their family and friends. I hope to keep in contact with several of them. I can't wait for more to come within the next 3 years while I am in high school. I would really like to host at least one and be able to let them experience life with my family here in America. I look forwards to getting to getting to know any of them within the next 3 years. Overall, it was really fun. I didn't try a lot of the food, but from what I heard from a friend it was really good.

<photo  date_taken="2006-08-26 12:47:49" description="Lajos &amp;quot;Louis&amp;quot; Kossuth (Ľudovít Košút in Slovak) (Monok, September 19, 1802–Turin, March 20, 1894) was a Hungarian lawyer, politician and Regent-President of the Kingdom of Hungary in 1849. He was widely honored during his lifetime, including in the United Kingdom and the United States, as a freedom fighter. Family Lajos Kossuth was born at Monok, a small town in the county of Zemplén as the oldest of four children. His father belonged to the minor nobility, had a small estate and was a lawyer by profession. The ancestors of the Kossuth family have lived in the county of Turóc (Slovak: Turiec) since the 13th century. They had spoken Slovak language in the past and Lajos' uncle, Juraj Košút, with whom Lajos used to spend his holidays, had remained a strong Slovak nationalist/patriot. The partly Slavic ancestry of Kossuth never became the topic of political debates because the family was part of the ruling Hungarus nobility of the Kingdom of Hungary. Also, Lajos considered himself a full Magyar (in the ethnic sense) and, interestingly, even openly denied the mere existence of a Slovak nation. The mother of Lajos Kossuth, Karolina Weber was of Lutheran German descent so Kossuth has Magyar, Slovak and German roots. Early years His mother raised the children as strict Lutherans. Kossuth completed his education at the Piarist college of Sátoraljaújhely and one year in the Calvinist college of Sárospatak and the University of Pest-Buda (now Budapest). Aged nineteen, he entered his father's legal practice. He was popular locally, and having been appointed steward to the countess Szapáry, a widow with large estates, he became her voting representative in the county assembly and settled in Pest. He was subsequently dismissed on the grounds of using estate funds to pay a gambling debt. Entry into national politics Shortly after his dismissal by Countess Szapáry, Kossuth was appointed as deputy to Count Hunyady at the National Diet. The Diet met during 1825–1827 and 1832–1836 in Pozsony, then capital of Hungary. Only the upper aristocracy could vote, however, and Kossuth took little part in the debates. At the time, a struggle to reassert a Hungarian national identity was beginning to emerge under able leaders – most notably Wesselényi and the Széchenyis. In part, this was also a struggle for reform against the stagnant Austrian government. Kossuth's duties to Count Hunyady included reporting on Diet proceedings in writing, as the Austrian government, fearing popular dissent, had banned published reports. The high quality of Kossuth's letters led to their being circulated in manuscript among other Liberal magnates. Readership demands turned his output into the editing of an organized parliamentary gazette (Országgyűlési tudósítások); spreading his name and influence further. Orders from the Official Censor halted circulation by lithograph printing. Distribution in manuscript by post was forbidden by the government, although circulation by hand continued. In 1836 the Diet was dissolved. Kossuth continued to report (in letter form), covering the debates of the county assemblies. This new-found publicity gave the assemblies national political prominence. Previously they had had little idea of each others' proceedings. His skilful embellishment of the speeches from the Liberals and Reformers further enhanced the impact of his newsletters. The government in vain attempted to suppress the letters, and other means having failed, he was in May 1837, with Wesselényi and several others, arrested on a charge of high treason. After spending a year in prison at Buda awaiting trial, he was condemned to four more years' imprisonment. His strict confinement damaged his health, but he was allowed to read. He greatly increased his political knowledge, and also acquired, from the study of the Bible and Shakespeare, a thorough knowledge of English. The arrests had caused great indignation. The Diet, which reconvened in 1839, demanded the release of the prisoners, and refused to pass any government measures. Metternich long remained obdurate, but the danger of war in 1840 obliged him to give way. Wesselényi had been broken by his imprisonment, but Kossuth, partly supported by the frequent visits of Teresa Meszleny, emerged from prison unbroken. Immediately after his release Kossuth and Meszleny were married, and she remained a firm supporter of his politics. The Roman Catholic priests refused to bless the marriage as Kossuth would not convert to Meszleny's religion. This experience influenced Kossuth's firm defense of mixed marriages. Journalist and political leader Kossuth had now become a national icon. He regained full health in January 1841 and was appointed editor of Pesti Hírlap, a new Liberal party newspaper. Notably, the government agreed to grant a licence. The paper achieved unprecedented success, soon reaching the then immense circulation of 7000 copies. A competing pro-government paper, Világ, started up but it only served to increase Kossuth's visibility and add to the general political fervour. The first Kossuth statue in Hungary. Miskolc, Erzsébet squareSzéchenyi, the great reformer, publicly warned Kossuth that his appeals to the passions of the people would lead the nation to revolution. Kossuth, undaunted, did not stop at the publicly reasoned reforms demanded by all Liberals: the abolition of entail, the abolition of feudal burdens and taxation of the nobles. He went on to broach the possibility of separating from Austria. By combining this nationalism with an insistence on the superiority of the Magyars to the Slavonic inhabitants of Hungary, he sowed the seeds of both the collapse of Hungary in 1849 and his own political demise. In 1844, Kossuth was dismissed from Pesti Hírlap after a dispute with the proprietor over salary. It is believed that the dispute was rooted in government intrigue. Kossuth was unable to obtain permission to start his own newspaper. In a personal interview Metternich offered to take him into the government service. Kossuth refused, and spent the next three years without a regular position. He continued to agitate on behalf of both political and commercial independence for Hungary. He adopted the economic principles of List, and was the founder of a &amp;quot;Védegylet&amp;quot; society – whose members consumed only Hungarian produce. He also argued for the creation of a Hungarian port at Fiume. In autumn 1847, Kossuth was able to take his final key step. Due to the support of Lajos Batthyány during a keenly fought campaign, he was elected to the new Diet as member for Pest. He proclaimed: &amp;quot;Now that I am a deputy, I will cease to be an agitator.&amp;quot; He immediately became chief leader of the Extreme Liberals. Ferenc Deák was absent. Batthyány, István Széchenyi, Szemere and József Eötvös, his political rivals, felt that his personal ambition and egotism led him to assume the chief place, and to use his parliamentary position to establish himself as leader of the nation; but before his eloquence and energy all apprehensions were useless. His eloquence was of that nature, in its impassioned appeals to the strongest emotions, that it required for its full effect the highest themes and the most dramatic situations. In a time of rest, though he could never have been obscure, he would never have attained the highest power. It was therefore a necessity of his nature, perhaps unconsciously, always to drive things to a crisis. Regent of Hungary The crisis came, and he used it to the full. On March 3, 1848, shortly after the news of the revolution in Paris had arrived, in a speech of surpassing power he demanded parliamentary government for Hungary and constitutional government for the rest of Austria. He appealed to the hope of the Habsburgs, &amp;quot;our beloved Archduke Franz Joseph&amp;quot; (then 17 years old), to perpetuate the ancient glory of the dynasty by meeting half-way the aspirations of a free people. He at once became the leader of the European revolution; his speech was read aloud in the streets of Vienna to the mob by which Metternich was overthrown (March 13), and when a deputation from the Diet visited Vienna to receive the assent of Emperor Ferdinand to their petition it was Kossuth who received the chief ovation. Batthyány, who formed the first responsible government, appointed Kossuth the Minister of Finance. With amazing energy he began developing the internal resources of the country: re-establishing a separate Hungarian coinage, and using every means to increase national self-consciousness Characteristically, the new Hungarian bank notes had Kossuth's name as the most prominent inscription; making reference to &amp;quot;Kossuth Notes&amp;quot; a future byword. A new paper was started, to which was given the name of Kossuth Hirlapja, so that from the first it was Kossuth rather than the Palatine or the president of the ministry whose name was in the minds of the people associated with the new government. Much more was this the case when, in the summer, the dangers from the Croats, Serbs and the reaction at Vienna increased. In a great speech July 11 he asked that the nation should arm in self-defence, and demanded 200,000 men; amid a scene of wild enthusiasm this was granted by acclamation. When Jellachich was marching on Pest he went from town to town rousing the people to the defence of the country, and the popular force of the Honved was his creation. When Batthyány resigned he was appointed with Szemere to carry on the government provisionally, and at the end of September he was made President of the Committee of National Defence. From this time he was a virtual dictator. The direction of the whole government was in his hands. Without military experience, he had to control and direct the movements of armies; he was unable to keep control over the generals or to establish that military co-operation so essential to success. Arthur Görgey in particular, whose great abilities Kossuth was the first to recognize, refused obedience; the two men were very different personalities. Twice Kossuth deposed him from the command; twice he had to restore him. It would have been well if Kossuth had had something more of Görgey's calculated ruthlessness, for, as has been truly said, the revolutionary power he had seized could only be held by revolutionary means (by which it is usually meant, revolutions can only be effected by dictatorship, repression and bloodshed); but he was by nature soft-hearted and always merciful; though often audacious, he lacked decision in dealing with men. It has been said that he showed a want of personal courage; this is not improbable, the excess of feeling which made him so great an orator could hardly be combined with the coolness in danger required of a soldier; but no one was able, as he was, to infuse courage into others. During all the terrible winter which followed, his energy and spirit never failed him. It was he who overcame the reluctance of the army to march to the relief of Vienna; after the defeat of Schwechat, at which he was present, he sent Bem to carry on the war in Transylvania. At the end of the year, when the Austrians were approaching Pest, he asked for the mediation of Mr Stiles, the American envoy. Windisch-Graetz, however, refused all terms, and the Diet and government fled to Debrecen, Kossuth taking with him the Crown of St Stephen, the sacred emblem of the Hungarian nation. In November 1848, Emperor Ferdinand abdicated in favour of Franz Joseph. The new Emperor revoked all the concessions granted in March and outlawed Kossuth and his colleagues. In April 1849, when the Hungarians had won many successes, after sounding the army, he issued the celebrated declaration of Hungarian independence, in which he declared that &amp;quot;the house of Habsburg-Lorraine, perjured in the sight of God and man, had forfeited the Hungarian throne.&amp;quot; It was a step characteristic of his love for extreme and dramatic action, but it added to the dissensions between him and those who wished only for autonomy under the old dynasty, and his enemies did not scruple to accuse him of aiming for Kingship. For the time the future form of government was left undecided, but Kossuth was appointed regent-president (to satisfy both royalists and republicans). The hopes of ultimate success were frustrated by the intervention of Russia; all appeals to the western powers were vain, and on August 11 Kossuth abdicated in favor of Görgey, on the ground that in the last extremity the general alone could save the nation. Görgey capitulated at Világos to the Russians, who handed over the army to the Austrians. Görgey was spared – at the insistence of the Russians. Reprisals were taken on the rest of the Hungarian army. Kossuth steadfastly maintained until his death that Görgey alone was responsible for the humiliation. Escape and Triumphant Tour of England and America Kossuth's time in power was at an end. A solitary fugitive, he crossed the Turkish frontier. He was hospitably received by the Turkish authorities, who, supported by the British, refused, notwithstanding the threats of the allied emperors, to surrender him and other fugitives to Austria. In January 1850 he was removed from Vidin, where he had been kept under house arrest, to Shumla, and thence to Kütahya in Asia Minor. Here he was joined by his children, who had been confined at Pozsony/Pressburg (Bratislava); his wife (a price had been set on her head) had joined him earlier, having escaped in disguise. In September 1851 he was allowed to leave Turkey on an American man-of-war. He first landed at Marseille, where he received an enthusiastic welcome from the people, but the Prince-President Louis Napoleon refused to allow him to cross France. On October 23 he landed at Southampton and spent three weeks in Britain, where he was generally feted. Addresses were presented to him at Southampton, Birmingham and other towns; he was officially entertained by the Lord Mayor of London; at each place he spoke eloquently in English for the Hungarian cause; and he indirectly caused Queen Victoria to stretch the limits of her constitutional power over her Ministers to avoid embarassment, and eventually helped cause the fall of the government in power. Having learnt English during an earlier political imprisonment with the aid of a volume of Shakespeare, his spoken English was 'wonderfully archaic' and theatrical. The Times, generally cool towards the revolutionaries of 1848 in general and Kossuth in particular, nevertheless reported that his speeches were 'clear' and that a three-hour talk was not unusual for him; and also, that if he was occasionally overcome by emotion when describing the defeat of Hungarian aspirations, 'it did not at all reduce his effectiveness'. At Southampton, he was greeted by a crowd of thousands outside the Lord Mayor's balcony, who presented him with a flag of the Hungarian Republic. The Corporation of London accompanied him in procession through the City, and the way to the Guildhall was lined by thousands of cheering people. He went thereafter to Winchester, Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham; at Birmingham the crowd that gathered to see him ride under the triumphal arches erected for his visit was described, even by his severest critics, as 75,000 individuals. Back in London he addressed the Trades Unions at Copenhagen Fields in Islington. Some twelve thousand 'respectable artisans' formed a parade at Russell Square and marched out to meet him. At the Fields themselves, the crowd was enormous; the Times estimated it conservatively at 25,000, while the Morning Chronicle described it as 50,000, and the demonstrators themselves 100,000. The Foreign Secretary, Lord Palmerston, who had already proved himself a friend of the losing sides in several of the failed revolutions of 1848, was determined to receive him at his country house, Broadlands. The Cabinet had to vote to prevent it; Queen Victoria reputedly was so incensed by the possibility of her Foreign Secretary supporting an outspoken republican that she asked the Prime Minister, Lord John Russell for Palmerson's resignation, but Russell claimed that such a dismissal would be drastically unpopular at that time and over that issue. When Palmerston upped the ante by receiving at his house, instead of Kossuth, a delegation of Trade Unionists from Islington and Finsbury, and listened sympathetically as they read an address that praised Kossuth and declared the Emperors of Austria and Russia 'despots, tyrants and odious assassins', it was noted as a mark of indifference to Royal displeasure. This, together with Palmerston's support of Louis Napoleon, caused the Russell government to fall and Palmerston himself to take office. In addition, the indignation which he aroused against Russian policy had much to do with the strong anti-Russian feeling which made the Crimean War possible. From Britain he went to the United States of America: there his reception was equally enthusiastic, if less dignified. He was the second foreign citizen to make a speech in the National Statuary Hall (Lafayette being the first). Later Exile and Death Gradually, his autocratic style and uncompromising outlook destroyed any real influence among the expatriate community. Other Hungarian exiles protested against his appearing to claim to be the only national hero of the revolution. Count Casimir Batthyány attacked him in The Times, and Szemere, who had been prime minister under him, published a bitter criticism of his acts and character, accusing him of arrogance, cowardice and duplicity. He soon returned to England, where he lived for eight years in close connection with Mazzini, by whom, with some misgiving, he was persuaded to join the Revolutionary Committee. Quarrels of a kind only too common among exiles followed. Hungarians were especially offended by his continuing use of the title of Regent. He watched with anxiety every opportunity of once more freeing his country from Austria. An attempt to organize a Hungarian legion during the Crimean War was stopped; but in 1859 he entered into negotiations with Napoleon III, left England for Italy and began the organization of a Hungarian legion, which was to make a descent on the coast of Dalmatia. The Peace of Villafranca made this impossible. From then on, Kossuth remained in Italy. He refused to follow the other Hungarian patriots, who, under the lead of Deák, negotiated the 1867 Compromise (Ausgleich), and the ensuing amnesty. It is doubted whether Emperor Franz Joseph would have allowed the amnesty to extend to Kossuth. Publicly, Kossuth remained unreconciled to the house of Habsburg, and committed to a fully independent state. Though elected to the Diet of 1867, he never took his seat. He continued to remain a widely popular figure, but did not allow his name to be associated with dissent or any political cause. A law of 1879, which deprived of citizenship all Hungarians who had voluntarily been absent ten years, was a bitter blow to him. He displayed no interest in benefitting from a further amnesty in 1880. In 1890, a delegation of Hungarian pilgrims in Turin recorded a short patriotic speech delivered by the elderly Lajos Kossuth. The original recording on two wax cylinders for the Edison phonograph survives to this day, although barely audible due to excess playback and unsuccessful early restoration attempts. Lajos Kossuth is the earliest born person in the world who has his voice preserved. He died in Turin on the 20th of March 1894; his body was taken to Budapest, where he was buried amid the mourning of the whole nation, Mór Jókai delivering the funeral oration. A bronze statue was erected, by public subscription, in the Kerepesi Cemetery. Many regard Kossuth as Hungary's purest patriot and greatest orator. Many points in Kossuth's career and character will probably always remain the subject of controversy. His complete works were published in Hungarian at Budapest in 1880-1895. The fullest account of the Revolution is given in Helfert, Geschichte Oesterreichs (Leipzig, 1869, &amp;amp;c.), representing the Austrian view, which may be compared with that of C Gracza, History of the Hungarian War of Independence, 1848-1849 (in Hungarian) (Budapest, 1894).

Memorials Today the main square of Budapest with the Hungarian Parliament Building is named after him and the Kossuth Memorial is an important scene of national ceremonies. Almost every town in Hungary has its own Kossuth Street or Kossuth Square and a statue of Kossuth, with the first public statue of him being the one in Miskolc, erected in 1898. The memorials of Lajos Kossuth in the territories lost by Hungary after World War I were sooner or later demolished in neighbouring countries. A few of them was re-erected following the fall of Communism by local councils or private associations. They play an important role as symbols of national identity of the Hungarian minority. The most important memorial outside the present-day borders of Hungary is a statue in Rožňava (hun: Rozsnyó), that was knocked down two times but restored after much controversy in 2004. The only Kossuth statue that remained on its place after 1920 in Romania stands in Salonta (hun: Nagyszalonta). The demolished Kossuth Memorial of Târgu-Mureş (hun: Marosvásárhely) was re-erected in 2001 in the little Székely village of Ciumani (hun: Gyergyócsomafalva). In Serbia there are two statues of Kossuth in Stara Moravica (hun: Ómoravica or Bácskossuthfalva) and Novi Itebej (hun: Magyarittebe). Memorials in Ukraine are situated in Berehove (hun: Beregszász) and Tiachiv (hun: Técső). Additionally, a bust of Lajos Kossuth is housed in the US Capitol Building in Washington D.C. Trivia The small town of Kossuth, Mississippi in the United States is named in honor of Lajos Kossuth. The largest county in Iowa, Kossuth County, is named in honor of Lajos Kossuth. In front of the County Court House in Algona, Iowa, (the county seat) stands a statue of the freedom fighter. Other statues of Kossuth remain sprinkled throughout the U.S., including in University Circle in Cleveland, Ohio. There is also a Kossuth Park at the intersection of East 121st Street and East Shaker Boulevard, just west of Shaker Square, in Cleveland.

<photo  date_taken="2011-07-23 09:52:43" description="Charles H Toll Residence 1038 Elden Ave Pico-Union Charles H. Toll is justly considered one of the important men of Southern California. A financier of prominence, he has been closely identified with the progress of Los Angeles County. He believes firmly in the future greatness of Southern California and has done all firmly in his power to help in its advancement. Although a very busy man he still has time to devote to the welfare of his community. Mr. Toll was born at Clinton, Iowa, November 24, 1858, a son of Hon. Charles Hulbert and Elizabeth (Lusk) Toll. His parents were natives of New York State. His father was an Iowa pioneer and was one of the men who really built up and developed Clinton as a city. He was a manufacturer there, and also held the office of postmaster. In all public affairs he was a leader. He was chosen to represent his district in the State Legislature and serve several terms with distinction. At the time of the Civil War he enlisted in the tenth Iowa Infantry, and was in the service until the end of the war. He was advanced to the rank of Major after the battle of Chickamauga and was put in charge of the Commissary Department. Major Toll died in Los Angeles in 1887. Charles H. Toll, the youngest of five children, grew up in Clinton, Iowa; acquired a public school education and finished in Cornell College at Mount Vernon, Iowa. For a time he was a clerk in the Clinton postoffice and later was deputy clerk of courts of Clinton County. Mr. Toll moved to Los Angeles in 1885. He was credit man for several large firms in the city and gradually became identified with business and finance in an ever increasing scope, so as a banker he has met with accustomed success and is a recognized power in the local money market. In 1900 he was chosen cashier of the Southern California Savings Bank, and upon its merger with the Security Trust and Savings Bank in 1906, was made a vice-president of the latter institution, which position he has since retained. He was a member of the city council of Los Angeles from 1896 to 1900. He is a vice chairman of the War Finance Corporation for the Twelfth Federal Reserve District; a member of the Glendale and Los Angeles Councils of Boy Scouts, being treasurer of the latter. He is a member of the Salvation Army Board, of Los Angeles County; belongs to the California, University Club; and the Athletic Club of Los Angeles; and the Chamber of Commerce of Glendale. He is a director of the Van Nuys State Bank; was one of the organizers and the first president of the Glendale State Bank, is a director of the Goodyear Textile Mills and a trustee of Harvard Military School. Politically, Mr. Toll is a Republican. In 1911 he moved to Glendale. His residence at 1635 Kenneth Road is one of the most spacious and attractive in Glendale, the residence grounds occupying seven acres. At Los Angeles, September 4, 1902, Mr. Toll married Eleanor Margaret Joy. She was born in Minnesota and came to California at the age of six. She is a daughter of William Henry and Ruth Anna (Dougherty) Joy. Her father is a descendant of Thomas Joy of Boston, Massachusetts, who came to America on February 20, 1637, from Norfolk county, England. An architect, Thomas Joy designed and built the first Town House of Boston, which served as the capitol building of Massachusetts from 1657 until its destruction by fire in 1711. This historic building (referred to by Emerson in his “Boston Hymn”) had for its site the open space at the head of what is now State Street. Many of the ancestors of Mrs. Toll, on both the father’s and the mother’s side, served in the colonial forces in the Revolutionary, and in the French and Indian Wars, and in the war of 1812; and her father served with distinction in the Eleventh Minnesota Volunteers, during the period of the Civil War. Mrs. Toll was graduated from the Oakland High Schools, and took Collegiate work privately with some of the ablest professors of two of the leading universities of California. She became a teacher and after a brief experience in the schools of Sonoma County, moved to Los Angeles County, where she was a resident at Pomona for a brief period, before becoming affiliated with the schools of Los Angeles. She pursued this calling for nearly fourteen years and was, at the time of her marriage to Mr. Toll, a member of the faculty of the Los Angeles High School. Four sons were born into the family: Charles Hulbert, Junior, now a senior at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Gerald Sidney, a junior at the University of California at Berkeley; Maynard Joy, who graduated from Glendale Union High School with the class of 1922; and Carroll Costello, a student at intermediate school. Mrs. Toll counts it as one of the great privileges of her life that she was enabled to teach her own boys for a period of two years each, before consigning them to the care of others. When her children became older, Mrs. Toll felt the call to the service of her community and resultant from her intense interest in the affairs of her sons in school, she became vice-president of the Parent-Teacher Federation of Glendale, serving in this capacity during the year of 1912 and 1913. She then became president of the Federation, which place she filled during the period 1914-1915. As Educational Chairman for this organization, she in 1916 founded the Mutual Benefit Reading Circle, under the care of the Bureau of Education at Washington. This organization met for four years, weekly, in Mrs. Toll’s home. Its numbers increased so greatly that its tow hundred members transferred their home to the Glendale Library. This Circle has been the motive for much widespread comment by the Bureau of Education, as it has been called in numerous bulletins issued by this department, “a model organization.” In 1917, Mrs. Toll was elected to the Board of Trustees of the Glendale Schools, defeating her opponent, a man, by a large majority. She served as president of the board for three years. On the formation of this Foothill Club in 1915, Mrs. Toll was made its first president. In 1918, Mrs. Toll became the first vice-president of the Ebell Club of Los Angeles, one of the largest, if not the largest, Women’s Clubs in the United States; which office she held for two years. She was then elected president of this organization, and served a complete term of office of two years in this well-known club, now being a member of its board of directors. In 1920, Governor Stephens appointed Mrs. Toll a member of the board of Trustees of the California School for Girls at Ventura, which position she still fills. &lt;a href=&quot;http://theusgenweb.org/ca/losangeles/GlendaleBios/Toll_Charles_H.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;theusgenweb.org/ca/losangeles/GlendaleBios/Toll_Charles_H...&lt;/a&gt; __________ Archive.org: Greater Los Angeles and Southern California, 1906: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.archive.org/details/greaterlosangele00burdrich&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.archive.org/details/greaterlosangele00burdrich&lt;/a&gt; Archive.org: Greater Los Angeles and Southern California, 1910: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.archive.org/details/greaterlosangele00burd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.archive.org/details/greaterlosangele00burd&lt;/a&gt;" id="5967930386" latitude="34.05178" license="3" longitude="-118.287742" nbComments="0" rank="35" tags="kansassebastian california losangeles historicwestadams architecture 1038eldenave charleshtollresidence picounion americancraftsman english elizabethan southerncaliforniasavingsbank securitytrustandsavingsbank" title="Greater Los Angeles 1906 - 1038 Elden Ave - Charles H Toll (Demolished)" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/6141/5967930386_2f2b7d2617_b.jpg" username="Kansas Sebastian" views="381" />

<photo  date_taken="2010-02-14 17:21:56" description="This tug-boat shaped building on the southeast corner of Jefferson and Pasfield Sts., is Springfield's Maid-Rite sandwich shop. Constructed as a restaurant in 1924, the business began operations two years before Maid-Rite was founded in Muscatine, Iowa. Independently owned, the Springfield location was one of the first Maid-Rite franchises in the country, and the Springfield location claims to have been the first restaurant with a drive-up window. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. If you are coming to Springfield to visit the Lincoln sites, be certain to add a stop at Maid-Rite to your schedule. Two Maids (loose-meat hamburgers), fries and a drink cost only $6.99, and places like this can't be found on every corner.

<photo  date_taken="2006-08-26 12:44:44" description="Home of architect Waddy Wood @ 2019 Q St. NW Waddy Butler Wood (1869 - January 25, 1944) was a prominent Washington, DC based American architect of the early 20th century. Although Wood designed and remodeled numerous private residences, his reputation rested primarily on his larger commissions, such as banks, commercial offices, and government buildings. His most famous works include the Woodrow Wilson House and the Department of the Interior headquarters building. Early life and education Waddy Wood was born in St. Louis, Missouri in 1869 to Capt. Charles Wood, a Virginian who had relocated west to seek better opportunities. His family returned to Virginia shortly after he was born. He grew up on the family estate, Spring Hill Farm (itself on the National Register of Historic Places), in Ivy, Gloucester County, Virginia. He eventually attended Virginia Polytechnic Institute for his advanced education. Early career In 1892 he entered the occupation of architecture working in Washington, DC. His first important commisions were on two streetcar barns. The first in 1896 was the East Capitol Street Car Barn, which he helped to design with engineer A.N. Connett, for the Metropolitan Railroad. Then in 1897 he designed the Georgetown Car Barn, then known as Union Station, for Capital Traction. The Georgetown Car Barn, incidentally, is best known for the famous &amp;quot;Exorcist Stairs&amp;quot; along the west side. He then designed several homes in what was then Kalorama Heights (now Adams Morgan). During this early period he worked with several other architects including Theodore Fredrich Laist, Edward Donn, Jr. and William I. Deming. Wood, Donn &amp;amp; Deming In 1902 he began an association with Edward Donn and William Deming, forming the firm of Wood, Donn and Deming. The firm was highly successful in Washington, DC providing services to various branches of government. Their designs can be found throughout the United States, including the expansion of the Portsmouth Naval Hospital in Portsmouth, Virginia. They also had a strong residential client base designing houses for prominent citizens such as Mrs. Phil Sheridan, General Charles Lane Fitzhugh and Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet; as well as public residences such as the Bachelor Apartment House near the White House. In 1906 Wood, Donn &amp;amp; Deming became the first D.C. architecture firm to design a bank high-rise in Washington when they designed the Union Trust building. National Savings &amp;amp; Trust, Riggs, American Security &amp;amp; Trust and the National Metropolitan Bank had each retained nationally renowned architects. D.C. architects were &amp;quot;only entrusted with branch banks and additions&amp;quot; until &amp;quot;Union Trust interrupted this trend by choosing Waddy Wood's firm of Wood, Donn &amp;amp; Deming&amp;quot; to design its headquarters at 15th and H streets, according to Commercial National's files in the National Register of Historic Places. Wood's work for Union Trust and later, on his own on the Commercial National Bank Building, the National Register files note, &amp;quot;represents a coming of age of the local architectural profession, particularly since both designs were published in national architectural journals.&amp;quot; National Museum of Women in the ArtsWood's partnership with Donn and Deming is best known for the firm's work in 1907 on the Masonic temple at 13th Street and New York Avenue NW, now the National Museum of Women in the Arts. The 69,000-square-foot building, a specimen of neo-Renaissance and Renaissance Revival styles, was declared a D.C. historic landmark in 1984 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. The building originally housed professional offices, the George Washington University law library and a movie theater in addition to the Masonic lodge hall. The exterior has never been altered substantially. As the Temple Association envisioned, the building's location at the tip of a wedge-shaped block provides an aesthetic buffer zone which &amp;quot;permits of no future building being erected sufficiently near to mar [the Temple's] monumental effect ... .&amp;quot; Despite the successes of Wood, Donn and Deming, the firm was dissolved in 1912, and Wood opened his own practice. Personal Practice The Woodrow Wilson House built in 1915 by architect Waddy Wood, the house is a fine example of the Georgian revival style. Waddy Wood's most famous buildings were created after he left Wood, Donn &amp;amp; Deming. In 1915 he built a home for Henry Parker Fairbanks, which was purchased by Woodrow Wilson in 1920 and became the Woodrow Wilson House (or the Fairbanks-Wilson house). As his reputation grew, his client list became quite prominent. In addition to President Wilson, he desinged a home for Howe P. Corcoran and remodeled the interior of Senator Oscar Underwood's home in Fairfax County - Woodlawn, a home originally designed by William Thornton, which Wood had worked on previously during his association with Donn and Deming. In the late 1910s, Wood was featured in an exhibition - at the famous Octagon - of architectural drawings by Washington architects. In 1920 after the Octagon exhibit, Wood was selected to present drawings for the National Architectural Exhibition at the Corcoran Galleries. The drawings selected were a mix of works between 1914 and 1920. A larger number were drawings of United States Housing Corporation buildings that he designed to house World War I workers. He also featured commercial buildings, such as the Shoreham Hotel and Commercial National Bank. His residential work featured at the exhibit included the Lawrence Lee Residence. During the World War I period, Wood designed many temporary wartime buildings in Washington. He did not take a fee for the cost of designing the buildings and as a result was praised by Franklin D. Roosevelt, then a partner of the law firm Roosevelt and O’Connor of New York. Roosevelt and Wood first became associated when Wood designed a house for Roosevelt’s uncle, Frederic Delano. Wood was active in the Democratic Party and their relationship continued after Roosevelt became President. Wood was commissioned to design the inauguration court of honor for President Roosevelt, as he had done for Roosevelt’s predecessor, Woodrow Wilson. Wood was a proponent of the Colonial Revival style. In a 1922 article authored by Wood and published in Country Life magazine, he stated that architecture was “frozen history” and evidence of our past. His romantic view of buildings and architecture had its source in the days of the Colonial period, when the craftsman worked their buildings into an art form. His proponence of the Colonial Revival extends beyond the romantic view of the link between our past and present, but to its economic sensibilities of the early 20th century. He argued that the heavy articulation of the Craftsman style was much more costly than the Colonial Revival which is more delicate and simplified. While many urban architects of the early 20th century applied classical design values with little adaptation, Wood spoke for an emerging school that regarded classical design as an accent to inspire and punctuate modern design. Though his government buildings are his most prominent, Wood was also recognized for his housing design. His former partner, William I. Deming, was skilled in the restoration of old homes, and during Wood’s association with Deming he was exposed to numerous renovations of historic houses in Virginia. He designed housing largely in Washington, DC, but also in Virginia for private clients, and some government clients. In addition, he designed school buildings for the Washington, DC school system. His greatest work is the Department of the Interior Headquarters Building in Washington, DC. Then Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes personally selected Waddy Wood as architect and worked very closely with him to ensure comfort and efficiency in the innovative new building. He was so involved with the design and construction of the Interior building that when the building opened, it was referred to as &amp;quot;Ickes new home.&amp;quot; The Interior building is 7 stories with a basement (an additional floor between the 5th and 6th stories is devoted entirely to mechanical equipment). Above the central axis is a setback 8th story. The building is arranged into 6 east-west wings connected by a central north-south spine. This massing creates ten U-shaped courts, allowing each of the 2200 rooms an exterior exposure. The Union Trust Bank BuildingThe Interior building featured a number of 'firsts' for Federal buildings: the first to have a central vacuum cleaning system, one of the earliest to be air-conditioned, and one of the first to incorporate a parking garage in the building. The somewhat austere 'Moderne' exterior belies the interior's abundant artwork and ornamentation. The building's 3 miles of corridors are lined with many murals and sculpture. Six Native American artists painted more than 2200 square feet of murals. The central corridor contains the Grand Staircase and has a checkered marble floor, bronze railings and a coffered plaster ceiling. A pair of marble bas reliefs by Boris Gilbertson adorn the walls: one of moose and the other of buffalo. The buffalo motif is found throughout the building including in the Departmental Seal and on the doorknobs of the Secretary of the Interior's Executive Suite. The Executive Suite has oak paneling with a marble fireplace. Besides offices, the building contains an auditorium, museum, Indian arts and crafts gift shop, library, post office and gymnasium-all part of the original design. In addition to his work, Waddy Wood served as the president of the Washington Chapter of the American Institute of Architects. In that capacity, he said in a 1928 speech &amp;quot;We will eventually build up a modern style of architecture based on evolution and not revolution, which has to rest, as all civilization does, on a foundation of precedent.&amp;quot; He died at his home near Warrenton, Virginia, January 25, 1944 Works Date added to the National Registry of Historical Places in Bold Waddy Wood - Early East Capitol Street Car Barn Washington, D.C.

Its got some nice old buildings in downtown, this wonderful old train depot which is now a museum, and a couple of nice places to eat as well. It is known as the Official Bluebird Capitol of Texas. Wills Point's village proper was formed in 1873. It was laid out at the highest elevation point between Ft. Worth and New Orleans by General Greenville M. Dodge from Iowa, then construction engineer for California Construction Company. Reportedly, it was first named Iola. According to legend, when early settlers petitioned Uncle Same for ti's own postal service, the name had to be changed because there was already postal service to a place called Iola. William Wills was the initial settler so Wills Point was submitted and accepted. Wills Point was also known as &amp;quot;The Queen City of the Praire&amp;quot;. The Texas and Pacific Railroad has been located in Wills Point since 1873. The town was built around the railroad.

In this case, a topless woman was just too much for the people of Illinois to bear (bare?) so Iowa purchased it from the artist (at a discount).

The gold leafing was replaced in 1964-1965 at a cost of $79,938. The dome is 275 feet above the ground floor and is 67 feet in diameter. Four smaller domes of simple design rise from the four corners of the Capitol. The Capitol grounds overlooks the city from a very large hill and is part of the East Village area. It's a great place to see fireworks in the summer or attend a political rally (of which there are many).

<photo  date_taken="2012-09-15 10:10:11" description="Iowa City is a city in Johnson County, State of Iowa. As of the 2010 Census, the city had a total population of about 67,862, a recent 2011 Census estimates the population at 68,947, making it the fifth-largest city in the state. Iowa City is the county seat of Johnson County and home to the University of Iowa. Iowa City is located adjacent to the town of Coralville, and it surrounds the town of University Heights, with which it forms a contiguous urban area. Iowa City is the principal city of the Iowa City Metropolitan Statistical Area, which encompasses Johnson County and Washington County, and this metropolitan area has a population of about 152,586. Iowa City was the second capital of the Iowa Territory, and it was also the first capital city of the State of Iowa. The Old Capitol building is a National Historic Landmark, and it is a tourist attraction in the center of the campus of the University of Iowa, as well as being an integral part of the university. The University of Iowa Art Museum and Plum Grove, the home of the first Governor of Iowa, are other tourist attractions. In 2008, Forbes Magazine named Iowa City the second-best small metropolitan area for doing business in the United States. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_city,_ia&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_city,_ia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_...&lt;/a&gt;" id="7993017022" latitude="41.658717" license="5" longitude="-91.55111" nbComments="0" rank="80" tags="" title="Iowa City, Iowa at Night from Flight from Chicago to Las Vegas, Nevada" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/8304/7993017022_44684a882d_b.jpg" username="Ken Lund" views="23" />

One of the most noticeable is the large mural above the main staircase. &amp;quot;Westward,&amp;quot; is an idealized representation of the arrival of the people who settled Iowa. This was completed as part of the 1904 decoration. On the upper floor level above the &amp;quot;Westward&amp;quot; painting are six mosaics in arched panels depicting Defense, Charities, the Executive, the Legislative, the Judiciary, and Education. These were made in Venice from small pieces of colored stone, according to designs by Frederick Dielman of New York. Finally, at the very top of the image you can see a stained glass skylight and painted ceiling. This is definitely one of the more impressive aspects of the capitol building. &lt;b&gt;More information:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://publications.iowa.gov/135/1/profile/8-3.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;publications.iowa.gov/135/1/profile/8-3.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_State_Capitol&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_State_Capitol&lt;/a&gt; This image was shot with a Canon 7d and15-85 lens.

<photo  date_taken="2011-07-11 20:27:43" description="&lt;b&gt;Photos of the bridges: See BELOW&lt;/b&gt; 3 bridges spanning the Carquinez Straits - The rusty old 20's railroad bridge remains the primary rail link between California's San Francisco and the state's capitol of Sacramento. This waterway was the main access for the California gold fields. &lt;b&gt;More detailed info:&lt;/b&gt; The Benicia-Martinez Bridges over the Carquinez Strait. The Benicia–Martinez Bridge refers to three parallel bridges which cross the Carquinez Strait just west of Suisun Bay; the spans link Benicia, California to the north with Martinez, to the south. . The 1.2 mile (1.9 km) deck truss bridge opened in 1962 as a &lt;b&gt;replacement for the last automotive ferry service in the San Francisco Bay Area&lt;/b&gt;. The 1962 bridge consists of seven 528-foot (161 m) spans which provide 138 feet (42 m) of vertical clearance. A 1.7 mile (2.7 km) bridge was built alongside and opened in 2007 carries five lanes of northbound traffic. The cost to construct the 1962 span was US$25 million and US$1.3 billion to build the 2007 span.[3] The bridge is part of Interstate 680, itself a major transportation link, and connects several other heavily traveled freeways. Between the two vehicle bridges is a railroad bridge owned and operated by the Union Pacific Railroad. The railroad bridge was the first bridge at this location,&lt;b&gt; built between April 1929 and October 1930 by the Southern Pacific Railroad&lt;/b&gt;. It is used by Union Pacific and BNSF (trackage rights) freight trains, as well as &lt;b&gt;36 scheduled Amtrak passenger trains each weekday&lt;/b&gt;. Passenger trains include the long-distance trains &lt;b&gt;California Zephyr and Coast Starlight&lt;/b&gt; as well as Capitol Corridor inter-city commuter trains. &lt;b&gt;The Battleship Iowa&lt;/b&gt; (BB-61) is anchored less than a mile East (left) of here, and had to pass under the bridges to enter Suisun Bay. She was not under her own power, but being moved by tugboats." id="5929008112" latitude="0" license="1" longitude="0" nbComments="1" rank="105" tags="bridge awesome benicia southernpacificrailroad decktruss interstate680 carquinezstrait beniciabridge abridgetoofar railroad tollbridge railway amtrak capitolcorridor martinez historic rusty crusty" title="Three Bridges Spanning 80 years" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/6006/5929008112_a8f3e2d7ef_b.jpg" username="Konabish ~ Greg Bishop" views="92" />

<photo  date_taken="2009-06-09 21:55:55" description="Rep. Bruce Braley (D-Iowa) speaks at the retirement ceremony to celebrate Joan Claybrook's years as president of Public Citizen. About 300 Public Citizen supporters packed the Sewall-Belmont House on Capitol Hill on Tuesday to honor Public Citizen's former president and consumer advocate extraordinaire, Joan Claybrook. Old friends of Public Citizen and Washington, D.C.’s progressive community came out to celebrate Joan’s 27 years of tireless leadership and her enduring legacy. Prior to the event, our headquarters building near Dupont Circle was named in her honor, Public Citizen’s Joan Claybrook Building. Washington Post’s Reliable Source columnists reported on some of Joan’s more illustrious fans: &amp;quot;As head of watchdog group Public Citizen for 27 years, she fought for safer cars, medicines, a whole slew of consumer products. In her wake, she gathered exasperated admirers who came to bid farewell: [Sen. John] McCain and Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.), who called her 'unrelenting'; Ralph Nader, who said she 'bitterly wants to win'; and brother Warren Buckler, who called her 'manipulative' — but in a good way.&amp;quot; Others in attendance included House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and Sen. Feingold, D-Wis, plus actor and environmentalist Robert Redford. The Associated Press reported: Redford honored Claybrook as a teacher, mentor and friend. “She taught me the ropes of how to lobby and how to develop patience, which is not my virtue,” he said. Here’s to many more years of relentless advocacy for Joan and Public Citizen!
