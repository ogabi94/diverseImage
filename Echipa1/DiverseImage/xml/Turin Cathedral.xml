<photo  date_taken="2012-12-08 13:24:44" description="La basilica di San Gaudenzio fu costruita nel punto più elevato di Novara tra il 1577 ed il 1690. L'incarico per il progetto fu afficato a Pellegrino Pellegrini, detto il Tibaldi, già architetto del cardinale Carlo Borromeo e di Filippo II di Spagna per il quale disegnò l'Escurial di Madrid. Nel maggio 1577 venne posata la prima pietra ma solo nel 1659 vennero completate le strutture architettoniche esterne. Ma il fattore architettonico più significativo è la grandiosa cupola, alta 121 metri, progettata dall'architetto-ingegnere Alessandro Antonelli (lo stesso della Mole di Torino), diventata simbolo grafico di Novara e visibile da tutti i lati della città. Il primo progetto della cupola di San Gaudenzio fu redatto da Alessandro Antonelli nel 1841. La struttura esteriore corrispondeva alle più moderne cupole di quel tempo, Saint Paul di Londra e Santa Genoveffa di Parigi. Negli anni seguenti l'edificazione rimase incompiuta a causa delle guerre per l'unità e l'indipendenza d'Italia e per sopraggiunti problemi di finanziamento. La costruzione fu poi completata definitivamente il 16 maggio 1878 con l’inserimento della statua del Salvatore, opera dello scultore milanese Pietro Zucchi. Novara - The dome of St. Gaudenzio The Basilica of San Gaudenzio was built on the highest point of Novara between 1577 and 1690. In the contract for the project was committed to Pellegrino Pellegrini, knon as Tibaldi, former architect of cardinal Carlo Borromeo and Philip II king of Spain for which designed the Escurial of Madrid. In May 1577 the foundation stone was laid but only in 1659 the outside architectural structures were totally completed. The most significant architectural factor is the great dome, 121 meters high, designed by the architect-engineer Alessandro Antonelli (the same as the Mole in Turin) that became the graphic symbol of Novara and it is visible from all sides of the city. The first draft of the dome of St. Gaudenzio was written by Alessandro Antonelli in 1841. The outer structure corresponded to the most modern domes that time, as St. Paul's in London and St. Genevieve of Paris. In the following years the building remained unfinished because of the wars for the unity and independence of Italy and due to unexpected financial problems. The building was finally completed in May 16, 1878 with the inclusion of the statue of Christ made by the sculptor Pietro Zucchi of Milan." id="8287951074" latitude="45.448179" license="1" longitude="8.619332" nbComments="98" rank="5" tags="novara piemonte italia chiesa cupola campanile barocco cattedrale cielo tetti baroque belltower cathedral church dome roofs sky antonelli architettura architecture me2youphotographylevel1 me2youphotographylevel2 rememberthatmomentlevel1" title="Novara – La cupola di San Gaudenzio" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/8213/8287951074_15a4d67d98_b.jpg" username="giovanni_novara" views="225" />

Philadelphia City Hall, 1871 - 1901 1 Penn Square, Philadelphia, PA John McArthur, Jr. &amp;amp; Thomas U. Walter Philadelphia City Hall is the house of government for the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. At 167 m (548 ft), including the statue, it is the world's second-tallest masonry building, only .5 m (1 ft 8 in) shorter than Mole Antonelliana in Turin.[3][4] The weight of the building is borne by granite and brick walls up to 22 feet (6.7 m) thick, rather than steel; the principal exterior materials are limestone, granite, and marble. It was the tallest habitable building in the world from 1901 to 1908 and the tallest in Pennsylvania until 1932 when surpassed by the Gulf Tower in Pittsburgh. It remained the tallest building in Philadelphia until the construction of One Liberty Place (1984–1987) ended the informal gentlemen's agreement that limited the height of tall buildings in the city; it is currently the 16th-tallest building in Pennsylvania. The building was designed by Scottish-born architect John McArthur, Jr., in the Second Empire style, and was constructed from 1871 until 1901 at a cost of $24 million. Designed originally to be the world's tallest building, by the time it was completed it had already been surpassed by the Washington Monument and the Eiffel Tower, though it was indeed the world's tallest habitable building at the time of opening. It also was the first modern building (excluding the Eiffel Tower, see above) to be the world's tallest and also was the first secular habitable building to have this record: all previous world's tallest buildings were religious structures, whether European cathedrals or, for the previous 3,800 years, the Great Pyramid of Giza.
