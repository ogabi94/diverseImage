<photo  date_taken="2010-07-03 15:48:26" description="The magnificent Longwood Mansion located in Natchez, Mississippi was constructed in 1860 by Haller Nutt, a wealthy Louisiana planter. Some say that the home was a gift to his wife Julia. In 1861, with the onslaught of the Civil war construction on the mansion was halted and never finished. Only the basement floor of the magnificent home was complete. Mr. Nutt lived there with his wife Julia ant their 8 children until his death in 1864. Julia continued to live there until her death in 1897. Breaking away from the traditional Greek Revival style of that era, Longwood is the largest octagonal home ever built in the U.S. Following an Oriental revival style of architecture, the home boasts approximately what would have been 30,000 sq. feet of living space. One can only imagine what it would have looked like had it been completed in all of its intended glory. The house still holds many of the original furnishings included Italian marble mantling. The plans called for ample windows and mirrors to be installed in the dome section of the house to be used to capture sunlight and reflect the light through light boxes in the Italian marble floors to the lower floors of the house. In the upper rooms, the brick was inlayed to hold Italian marble statues. The exterior of the house is brick but the original plans were to stucco the brick, which would have given it the look of a fairy-tale castle. Nestled on top of a hill, surrounded by mighty live oaks, cedars and magnolia trees, overlooking small streams with banks, carpeted in ferns, Longwood stands today just like she was left in 1861. Inside the walls of Longwood are still boxes of nails and construction debris along with shipping crates still bearing the name of Julia Nutt. I can only imagine how Longwood would look if she had been completed but even in this state of incompleteness, she is an architectural masterpiece." id="4761595751" latitude="0" license="1" longitude="0" nbComments="4" rank="1" tags="longwoodplantation longwood octagonalhome mansion antebellumhome natchezmississippi hallernutt msm62166 nikond70s" title="Longwood-0113" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/4080/4761595751_58daff6078_b.jpg" username="MSMcCarthy Photography" views="147" />

Luckily there was a side complex with a porch so I was able to snap some images as the rain comes down. The Longwood Plantation is a place that anyone who is visiting the area around Natchez, Mississippi should strive to visit. It is one of the most often visited and photographed places around Natchez, and has even been featured on television specials. &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fiveprime.org/blackmagic/l&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;View large on black&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Copyright © Kay Gaensler Photography - Creative Commons Check out my portfolio at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ensler.de&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.ensler.de&lt;/a&gt; You can also find me on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/people/Kay-Gansler/1073752967&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/Gaensler&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;b&gt;Please, don't leave awards or fav without a comment (even a small one), thank you !!!&lt;/b&gt;" id="4920101376" latitude="31.537223" license="1" longitude="-91.40551" nbComments="13" rank="11" tags="2010 america amerika gaensler gänsler hdr kay longwoodplantation mississippi natchez roadtrip sommer staaten states summer trip us usa united vacation vereinigte vereinigtestaaten geo:lat=3153722300 geo:lon=9140551067 geotagged wwwenslerde" title="Longwood Plantation" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/4121/4920101376_a414ac5ef7_b.jpg" username="Kay Gaensler" views="508" />

<photo  date_taken="2010-07-03 15:49:01" description="The magnificent Longwood Mansion located in Natchez, Mississippi was constructed in 1860 by Haller Nutt, a wealthy Louisiana planter. Some say that the home was a gift to his wife Julia. In 1861, with the onslaught of the Civil war construction on the mansion was halted and never finished. Only the basement floor of the magnificent home was complete. Mr. Nutt lived there with his wife Julia ant their 8 children until his death in 1864. Julia continued to live there until her death in 1897. Breaking away from the traditional Greek Revival style of that era, Longwood is the largest octagonal home ever built in the U.S. Following an Oriental revival style of architecture, the home boasts approximately what would have been 30,000 sq. feet of living space. One can only imagine what it would have looked like had it been completed in all of its intended glory. The house still holds many of the original furnishings included Italian marble mantling. The plans called for ample windows and mirrors to be installed in the dome section of the house to be used to capture sunlight and reflect the light through light boxes in the Italian marble floors to the lower floors of the house. In the upper rooms, the brick was inlayed to hold Italian marble statues. The exterior of the house is brick but the original plans were to stucco the brick, which would have given it the look of a fairy-tale castle. Nestled on top of a hill, surrounded by mighty live oaks, cedars and magnolia trees, overlooking small streams with banks, carpeted in ferns, Longwood stands today just like she was left in 1861. Inside the walls of Longwood are still boxes of nails and construction debris along with shipping crates still bearing the name of Julia Nutt.
